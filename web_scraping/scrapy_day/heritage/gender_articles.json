Skrmetti. At issue is the constitutionality of a Tennessee law, SB1 (codified at Tenn. Code Ann. § 68-33-103(a)(1)), which prohibits any medical procedure for the purpose of “Enabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor’s sex,” and “Treating purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor’s sex and asserted identity.” Tennessee is one of 26 states that have enacted such restrictions on surgeries and drugs designed to change ’a minor’s appearance so as to better resemble the opposite sex. Challenges to laws of this type are generally brought by parents who seek medical interventions for their minor children professing a gender identify that differs from their biological sex. The parents in the underlying litigation, L.W. v. Skrmetti, had argued that SB1 violated the 14th Amendment’s Due Process Clause by depriving them of their parental right to make medical decisions for their children. The plaintiffs also alleged that the law offended that amendment’s Equal Protection Clause which provides that no state can “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws” by discriminating based on sex. The 6th Circuit Court of Appeals found SB1 to be constitutional under both a due process and equal protection analysis and upheld the law. Last year, the 8th Circuit struck down a similar Arkansas law, but only on equal protection grounds. The United States thereafter intervened in the Skrmetti case to advance the Equal Protection Clause argument. >>> It’s Time for the Supreme Court to Repudiate Gender Ideology U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar and American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) attorney Chase Strangio argued for the government and the parents, respectively, contending that SB1 should be seen as a sex-based restriction and assessed under intermediate scrutiny review, which requires that any gender-based distinction in a law must be substantially related to achieving an important government objective—a burden the state had failed to meet. Tennessee Solicitor General J. Matthew Rice argued that rather than discriminating based on sex, the law merely restricted access to certain medical interventions based on age and the type of medical purpose for which such interventions would be used. Therefore, Rice argued that, as a routine exercise of the state’s power to regulate medicine generally, rational basis review—requiring only that a law be rationally related to achieving a legitimate government objective—was appropriate. During the two-and-a-half hour arguments, five of the Court’s conservative Justices seemed skeptical of the benefit of providing largely experimental gender affirming care for minors, and of the notion that the Court should have a role in making determinations about the complex medical issues underlying the dispute—rather than leaving these decisions to the legislatures. In one line of questioning, the Chief Justice John Roberts pressed ACLU attorney Strangio, saying that the case involved a “question of constitutional allocation of authority . . . [M]y understanding is that the Constitution leaves that question to the people’s representatives rather than to nine people, none of whom is a doctor.” Justice Brett Kavanaugh echoed the Chief’s concerns, asking Prelogar, “[I]f the Constitution doesn’t take sides, if there’s strong, forceful scientific policy arguments on both sides in a situation like this, why isn’t it best to leave it to the democratic process?” She responded that if the Court were concerned with protecting the democratic process in this area, it could author a narrow opinion that simply declares that intermediate scrutiny review applies and then sends the case back to the lower court to reconsider the merits under that standard rather than the rational basis standard of review. Justice Samuel Alito was particularly concerned with what he saw as Prelogar’s cavalier dismissal of the increasing body of scientific evidence casting doubt on the benefits of gender affirming care for minors. Among recent developments in western Europe indicating a growing distrust for early gender intervention, Alito cited the landmark Cass Report released earlier this year, noting that the report indicated “There is no evidence that gender-affirmative treatments reduce suicide;” he chided Prelogar, saying she had “relegated the Cass report to a footnote.” The Court’s three liberal Justices seemed to accept Prelogar’s argument that by incorporating the “sex classification into the face of the law and ma[king] the first-order restriction here one that prohibits inconsistency with sex . . . the legislature was doing something different in trying to get minors to appreciate their sex and not become disdainful. That’s not a medical-based justification.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor in particular pushed Rice on his characterization of the law as simply a restriction based on age and medical purpose, arguing that a doctor would have to know whether the child seeking gender transition drugs is male or female to know whether SB1 would ban the use of those drugs. She argued that was “very hard to see how the democratic process” would protect transgender individuals, much as it didn’t protect women or people of color for decades. Justice Elena Kagan also expressed the view that SB1 was a sex-based classification, saying the medical purpose of SB1 “is utterly and entirely about sex.” >>> Wisconsin Public Schools’ Gender Policies Shut Out Parents, Violate Their Rights A brief line of questioning concerned whether transgender status could qualify as a suspect or quasi-suspect class for purposes of equal protection analysis—as the government had requested in the second half of its brief. As Justice Amy Coney Barrett was quick to point out, the suspect classes previously recognized by the Court were distinguishable from the purported class of transgender individuals in that they had suffered a long history of de jure discrimination. She also noted that the Court has been asked to identify new suspect classes based on characteristics such as age and disability, but has so far declined. Barrett also emphasized that whatever the Court’s decision, the separate, due process-based question of whether SB1 infringes on the fundamental rights of parents to make medical decisions for their children would remain active. Notably quiet throughout the entirety of oral arguments was Justice Neil Gorsuch—author of the majority opinion in the Court’s only other gender identity case to date, 2022’s Bostock v. Clayton County. In Bostock, the Court found that sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 includes discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity because sexual orientation and transgender status are “inextricably bound up with sex.” In his analysis for the Bostock majority, Gorsuch wrote that when an employer tolerates attitudes or behaviors in one sex but not in another, and then terminates an employee based on such attitudes or behaviors, impermissible sex-based discrimination has occurred. It was perhaps the Court’s ruling in Bostock that prompted Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s allusion to the court’s decision in 1967 in Loving v. Virginia striking down Virginia’s ban on interracial marriage. In a dialogue with Prelogar, Jackson argued that both cases involved “generalizations of how we expect [certain groups] to—to live and order their affairs.” Prelogar agreed, noting that there was “a parallel between any law that says you can’t act inconsistent with a protected characteristic.” Whether Gorsuch was simply being thoughtful or was preoccupied with misgivings about Bostock’s impact on the burgeoning field of transgender rights, we’ll only know when the decision comes down next year."},
{"title": "Trump’s Transgender Orders Are Well Within Executive Authority", "author": ["Paul J. Larkin", "Sarah Parshall Perry"], "date": "Feb 19, 2025 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/trumps-transgender-orders-are-well-within-executive-authority", "takeaways": ["They claim the president’s directive prohibiting expenditure of federal funds for the purpose of performing transgender treatment or surgery is illegal.", "The president’s executive order is not ultra vires because it does not violate any specific federal law.", "The president’s executive order easily satisfies the lowest tier of judicial scrutiny."], "text": "In two short weeks, President Donald Trump has issued scores of executive orders, many of them related to gender identity. Outraged critics claim that he lacks the authority to do so. Do they have a case? Consider first the orders themselves. In addition to recognition of a formal two-sex policy for the whole of government, Trump issued executive orders barring trans-identified individuals from service in the military, requiring the removal of preferred pronouns in all government communiques, and directing all federally funded educational institutions to maintain athletic programs separated by biological sex, rather than gender identity. One particular executive order of January 28, 2025—“Protecting Children from Chemical and Surgical Mutilation”—directed all federal agencies, among others, to “immediately take appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving Federal research or education grants end gender-affirming medical care for people under nineteen.” It also directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to “end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children,” including through Medicare or Medicaid conditions of participation or conditions for coverage,” and through “section 1557 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,” the ACA’s non-discrimination provision. An unsurprising flurry of litigation ensued, and, in the most recent, the American Civil Liberties Union sued the president and various federal executives on behalf of national LGBTQ+ advocacy organization, PFLAG, and a group of trans-identified minors and their parents. >>> Gender Ideology Threatens Religious Freedom and Endangers Children Chief among their claims is that this executive order is beyond the scope of the president’s authority (or ultra vires) because Congress—not the executive—controls the power of the public purse. Therefore, they claim, the president’s directive prohibiting expenditure of federal funds for the purpose of performing transgender treatment or surgery is illegal for two reasons: First, Congress has already appropriated funds to be disbursed through HHS without any such limitation, and second, the president cannot revise the text of statutes passed by Congress and signed into law. But that argument conflates apples with oranges. Yes, appropriations bills are acts of Congress and therefore are statutes. And, yes, Congress passed, and then-President Joe Biden signed into law, the appropriations bill on which plaintiffs rely. But appropriations acts are not identical to statutes that regulate public or private conduct—and that difference matters. Appropriations laws fund the operation of government. That is critical because, under the Antideficiency Act, government officials may not spend undisbursed federal funds, nor may they encumber the federal government by using a credit card to run up debt. In fact, it is a crime to do so. Appropriations laws, however, operate against a background of substantive laws empowering government officials to take certain actions and prohibiting those officials from taking others. For example, the Defense Authorization Act passed annually by Congress fixes the number of aircraft carriers that the Defense Department may have. The bill that funds the Defense Department then limits the amount that DOD can spend during a particular fiscal year building new carriers. Moreover, congressional appropriators, and the appropriations bills that wend their way through the legislative process, do not generally make new substantive law through the appropriations process. The United States Supreme Court made that clear in the well-known case of Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill (1978). In that case, the court addressed the issue of whether Congress had effectively repealed the Endangered Species Act (ESA) by repeatedly funding the operation of the Tellico Dam and Reservoir Project, even though its continued operation put at risk the continued existence of an endangered small fish, known as the snail darter. The court roundly rejected the argument that continued funding of the dam implicitly repealed the ESA: While Congress could make new substantive law through appropriations bills, should it choose to do so, there is one condition. In Robertson v. Seattle Audubon Society (1992), the Supreme Court explained that Congress can legislate through appropriations laws but only “as long as it does so clearly.” The plaintiffs in PFLAG, et al. v. Trump, however, do not cite the text of any substantive or appropriations statute law that President Trump violated, so the TVA v. Hill rule applies here. Accordingly, the president’s executive order is not ultra vires because it does not violate any specific federal law. The PFLAG plaintiffs have also brought various constitutional claims in their lawsuit—including the parents’ claim that the order violates their Fourteenth Amendment substantive due process right to direct the medical care of their minor children, and a claim that the order violates the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause because it “discriminate[s] based on sex and transgender status.” They also claim that the order violates the First Amendment. Those claims are unpersuasive. >>> It’s Time for the Supreme Court to Repudiate Gender Ideology The Supreme Court will decide this term whether discrimination based on alleged or proven transgender status is entitled to any heightened scrutiny under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. The majority of justices expressed skepticism during oral arguments in United States v. Skrmetti that it would. As for the general right to direct the medical care of one’s minor children, neither the Supreme Court nor any other federal court has ever held that access to experimental, contested, or unproven medical interventions is constitutionally guaranteed. Atop that, the court has expressly held—twice, in Maher v. Roe (1977) and Harris v. McRae (1980)—that even if a party has a constitutional right to select certain medical care, the government has no constitutional duty to pay for their choice. As for the plaintiff’s First Amendment claim—that by “withholding federal grants, the [order] engage[s] in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment and violate the rights of grant recipients and transgender patients”—there is nothing to remotely suggest this is so. In Prince v. Massachusetts (1944), the court rejected the claim that the First Amendment’s Free Exercise Clause prohibits a state from applying its child labor laws to the Jehovah’s Witnesses. Also, in Jehovah’s Witnesses v. King’s County Hospital Unit No. 1 (1968), the court rejected a claim by parents that the state should not be able to provide life-saving treatment to their child against their religious wishes. Given those two decisions, there is no serious argument that the president’s executive order is unconstitutional. The president’s executive order easily satisfies the lowest tier of judicial scrutiny, rational basis, in that the government clearly has a legitimate state interest (protecting vulnerable minors), and there is clearly a rational connection between that interest and the executive order’s means and goals. Given that the most recent and comprehensive study of medical transgender treatment (England’s nine-year Cass Report released last year) found no proven long-term medical benefit from these treatment for minors, the president’s executive order is all the more constitutionally sound. Objection overruled."},

They happily marched in lockstep to President Joe Biden’s executive order directing every federal agency chief to prohibit discrimination based on gender expression or identity—case law to the contrary be damned. Now, however, those same politicians are apoplectic over the current administration’s return to biological reality, the rule of law and common sense. Leading the charge are Reps. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), Mark Takano (D-Calif.) and Gerry Connolly (D-Va.). In a letter to acting director of the Office of Personnel Management Charles Ezell, the trio stridently assert that President Trump’s executive order recognizing a government-wide “two sexes” policy and the accompanying memorandum guiding its implementation are unconstitutional. One of the three has a law degree, but that certainly doesn’t bolster their cock-eyed legal conclusions. Among its flaws, the letter cites the Supreme Court’s 1996 decision in Roemer v. Evans for the proposition that “government policies motivated by animus are clear violations of the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection of the laws.” Roemer involved a state constitutional amendment that forbade any legislative, judicial or executive protection to gays suffering discrimination—leaving them completely without the ability to participate in the political process, in violation of the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause. >>> Trump’s Transgender Orders Are Well Within Executive Authority The president’s EO and federal directives on gender identity, in contrast, disenfranchise no one. Rather, they restore to women the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause, motivated by the legitimate government interest in protecting their personal safety, privacy and equality. The EO simultaneously shields religious objectors to gender orthodoxy from being discriminated against for simply following the dictates of their conscience. What’s more, the Supreme Court has never placed transgender identity in the same category as biological sex, requiring the same heightened level of judicial scrutiny. This renders any government action implicating transgender status presumptively constitutional. The court explained this in Frontiero v. Richardson (1973): “[S]ince sex, like race and national origin, is an immutable characteristic determined solely by the accident of birth, the imposition of special disabilities upon the members of a particular sex because of their sex would seem to violate ‘the basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility.'” Unlike sex, transgender status is not immutable—something even a transgender attorney representing the ACLU had to admit under questioning from Justice Samuel Alito during oral arguments just two months ago in United States v. Skrmetti. Gender identity is a subjective, internal, malleable and often transitory sense of oneself. As such, it is an insufficient basis to expand the notion of equal protection or protection of “immutable characteristics”—one that would defy decades of Supreme Court jurisprudence to the contrary. The congressional letter also cites the court’s decision in 2020, Bostock v. Clayton County, which held that an employer who fires an individual merely for being gay or transgender violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act—a federal law prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of, among other things, sex. The court in that decision did not, however, equate sex with transgender status or sexual orientation. Rather, it determined only that both were “inextricably bound up with sex.” >>> Tyrants of the Imperious Judiciary: Federal Judge Orders “Gender Reassignment” for Child Killer The Bostock decision has repeatedly been cited by the left to argue that the court’s ruling on a federal employment law statute forbidding sex discrimination somehow magically transforms every federal law and regulation into one also forbidding gender identity discrimination. The congressmen fail to acknowledge what Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion—that there are indeed “biological distinctions between male and female.” Without exposition or evidence, the congressmen also argue that the “directive to withdraw [Biden’s gender identity] regulations in a matter of days contradicts the Administrative Procedure Act.” That APA governs the process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations and other agency actions such as policy statements and guidances. But if these congressmen fully understood the operation of the APA, they would recognize that rules can only be amended or reversed through a subsequent agency rulemaking process. That process is precisely what the appropriate agencies have been tasked with doing, pursuant to the EO and associated memorandum. It involves publishing a “notice of proposed rulemaking”—something that can easily be accomplished within 30 days, and which starts the long, detailed process set forth in the APA of recission through new rule construction. In their quixotic and legally faulty letter, the congressmen are tilting at windmills. What the current administration is doing is legal, common-sense and long overdue."},

"], "text": "The Supreme Court has said that parents’ right to direct the upbringing of their children is “perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests” it has ever recognized. But that right is under attack in Wisconsin public school districts that have established policies catering to children’s feelings about being a boy, a girl or something else, but deliberately keep parents in the dark about what they are doing. The Madison Metropolitan School District’s gender policy defines “gender identity” as an internal “sense of being male, female, a blend of both or neither—how individuals perceive themselves.” Children, of course, get ideas from all sorts of places, including social media, and the number who question whether they are “born in the wrong body” is exploding. Schools are generally in charge of matters such as curriculum or school administration. Whether a child imagines himself as a girl (which may change tomorrow as well) is an altogether different matter. As a federal judge recently put it: “Teaching a child how to determine one’s gender identity” strikes “at the heart of parental decision making in a matter of greatest importance in their relationship with their children.” More Wisconsin public schools not only take a student’s latest indication of gender identity at face value but have also created school policies catering to it. The Milwaukee Public Schools policy puts a student, regardless of age, in charge of who knows anything about his current gender identity, including parents. In fact, unless official school records have been formally changed, the policy prohibits school personnel from even implying anything about “a student’s actual or perceived gender identity … when contacting parents/guardians.” Milwaukee’s policy also says that students are allowed to dress, access restrooms and locker rooms and participate in physical education classes, clubs, sports and activities “in a manner consistent with their gender identity.” The Eau Claire Area School District policy is similar, permitting students to “participate in any intramural sports/extracurricular activity in a manner consistent with their gender identity.” Access to restrooms and locker rooms, the policy states, “should be allowed based on the gender identity (i.e., man, woman, trans, non-binary, etc.) expressed by the student.” A group of parents has challenged that policy in court, and their case is pending on a petition for review at the U.S. Supreme Court. These gender policies create jarring inconsistencies with how school districts handle far less significant matters. Milwaukee’s public schools, for example, require that a “separate parental permission slip must be obtained for each field trip.” At the same time, its gender policies allow students to “participate in an overnight field trip and utilize facilities and accommodations that correspond with their gender identity.” Since students can keep their parents from knowing about their gender identity, there’s no way to ensure that Johnny’s parents understand that he might be bunking with the girls when asked for permission for an overnight excursion. Wisconsin public schools are not alone in establishing these policies. Nearly 1,100 school districts across the country, with 11.5 million students attending 19,600 schools, have joined the gender revolution. And it’s about to get worse. A sweeping new rule by the Biden administration’s Department of Education will push schools even harder to impose the government’s gender ideology on students and force parents to get on board or be ignored. This rule reworks Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in educational programs receiving federal funds. For more than 50 years, Title IX has created and expanded opportunities for women and girls. This new rule, however, redefines “sex” to include “gender identity,” something Congress certainly did not intend when enacting the law more than five decades ago. The rule also redefines “harassment” so that staff and teachers could face disciplinary action if they “misgender” a student. This massive federal mandate carries the implied threat that billions of dollars in federal funds could be revoked if schools don’t knuckle under and enforce the Biden administration’s gender ideology. Whether at the school district, state or federal level, the government is pushing parents aside and imposing its preferred gender ideology, invading the realm that has traditionally belonged to parents. In fact, policies that exclude parents violate their constitutional right to direct the upbringing of their children. It’s time for parents to fight back against policies in their children’s schools, oppose state laws that allow those policies and speak out against federal rules that promote a divisive agenda at their expense."},

The Department of Health and Human Services under President Joe Biden took the position that funding appropriated by Congress through the Medicaid, Medicare and Affordable Care Act appropriations bill could be used to support such care. But appropriations bills do not—unless otherwise specified—create substantive law. And in this case, the bills did not create a requirement that funds be used in this way. Just as the Biden administration said that, for example, a contract with a state Medicaid recipient could provide “gender-affirming care,” the Trump administration is well within its right to say “stop.” The plaintiffs in PFLAG v. Donald Trump have not alleged that Trump’s executive order violates the law—because there is no law for him to violate. They simply want the government to pay for transgender surgeries and treatments for minors from which many developed nations have retreated. Hospitals, clinics and medical providers are free to offer these services all they want. But the government is under no obligation to pay for them. Thankfully, Hurson’s order is not a determination on the merits of the plaintiffs’ case, but merely a procedural determination. He still has time to get it right."},

But then someone like Richard Young comes along. Young, a Clinton-appointed federal district court judge in Indiana, just ordered the state’s Department of Corrections to provide sex reassignment surgery to a man who wants to masquerade as a woman—a man who is in prison for murdering a baby. That, shockingly, is what Young did in his order in Autumn Cordellione v. Indiana. Lest you be fooled by the name “Autumn” or the fact that Young refers to “Autumn” as “Ms.” and “her” throughout his disgraceful opinion, this criminal’s real name is Jonathan Richardson. He is in prison for strangling his 11-month-old stepdaughter to death in 2001. Richardson, who the judge refers to in his order as the “individual” or the “incarcerated transgender person,” is being represented by the ACLU in this lawsuit, in which Richardson demands that he be provided with “gender-affirming surgery.” Really, how can anyone justify making contributions to the ACLU when it engages in this type of despicable litigation? >>> Why Is Congress Facilitating Prison Rape in the Name of Fairness? Indiana has already provided this male child killer with “panties, makeup, and form-fitting clothing” while in prison—a place that, if justice is served for this vicious crime, Richardson will never, ever leave. But as Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita says, “Convicted murderers don’t get to demand that taxpayers foot the bill for expensive and controversial sex-change operations. It defies all common sense.” Au contraire, according to Young. He says that Indiana’s failure to provide Richardson with the surgery necessary to cut off his penis and give him fake breasts violates the Eighth Amendment. If this wasn’t a real order from a real federal judge, you’d think it was something written for The Babylon Bee or Mad magazine. The Eighth Amendment prohibits the infliction of “cruel and unusual punishments.” As the Heritage Guide to the Constitution explains, the amendment was included in order to prevent the type of “torturous punishments” often inflicted by the British Crown, like “pillorying, disemboweling, decapitation, and drawing and quartering.” Yet for decades, opponents have tried to use the ban on “cruel and unusual punishments” to outlaw the death penalty altogether. The Supreme Court ended that in 1976 in Gregg v. Georgia, when it held that the death penalty is not a per se violation of the Eighth Amendment. The court has further held in a series of cases that under the Eighth Amendment, punishments cannot be disproportionate to the offense. But it also held just last year in City of Grants Pass v. Johnson, a case illustrating the extremes to which those trying to misuse the Eighth Amendment will go, that public bans on camping in public parks are not “cruel and unusual punishment.” That claim was just as absurd as the ACLU’s claim in the Richardson case. Young relies on his opinion in the guidelines on “gender dysphoria” issued by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, as well as some other so-called experts. WPATH’s work and medical opinions have been severely criticized for bias and lack of scientific rigor. It has also been accused of suppressing research that contradicts its opinions. Young dismissed the opinion of the treating psychologist at Richardson’s prison that Richardson has personality disorders, not “gender dysphoria,” that display “an established pattern of attention-seeking behavior.” Richardson is certainly getting that attention with Young’s decision that not providing him with gender surgery is “cruel and unusual punishment.” But we shouldn’t be surprised. Young is the same judge who in 2018 struck down an Indiana law that required healthcare providers to report abortion complications to the state health department in PPINK v. Indiana. >>> Trump’s Transgender Orders Are Well Within Executive Authority In other words, when the health and lives of real women were endangered by botched abortions performed by incompetent physicians who committed malpractice, Young prevented state health authorities from being able to do anything about it. Young apparently believes in protecting only fake women, not real ones. As this case demonstrates, it isn’t only the Trump administration that’s dealing with an arrogant, imperial judiciary that ignores the Constitution and the rule of law and acts far outside of its authority. State governments are also on the receiving end of outlandish and bizarre orders like this one. The Supreme Court recently declined to intervene—at least for now—in Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, in which the Trump administration is dealing with another rogue judge who has ordered the government to distribute $2 billion of taxpayer money without examining the serious defenses raised by the government. In a dissent from the court’s refusal to hear the case, which was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh, Justice Samuel Alito wrote: The taxpayers and residents of Indiana should also be stunned by the actions of Judge Richard Young who used his thus-far-unchecked power to force them to pay for a sex change operation for a child murderer, the worst of the worst. Stunned indeed."},

As if Arizona parents didn’t already have their hands full in helping their children navigate the waters of adolescent sexuality, gender activists are increasingly using the public schools to lead students down a path their parents may know nothing about. And the Biden-Harris administration is making it worse. Like many others, the Tucson Unified School District’s gender policy defines “gender identity” as “an individual’s internal sense of gender.” This “internal sense” might be anything from a fleeting feeling, prompted by a suggestion on social media, to a clinically significant diagnosis of gender dysphoria requiring medical treatment. >>> Public School Gender Policies That Exclude Parents Are Unconstitutional These policies, however, prohibit efforts to tell the difference. They require that a student’s assertion of gender identity, which can change at any time, be taken at face value. Not only that, but schools implement a range of policies that cater to this assertion. The Kayenta Unified School District policy, for example, requires that students be addressed by “a name and pronoun that corresponds to the student’s gender identity.” Similarly, the Mesa Unified School District policy provides that students, regardless of age, may participate in physical education and sports; use restrooms, locker rooms, and shower facilities; and participate in “any other circumstances where students are separated by gender,” including “overnight field trips…in accordance with their gender identity.” It’s important to emphasize that these policies have nothing to do with a school’s curriculum or administration. Everyone agrees that schools have primary authority in those areas. Instead, these policies simply impose schools’ gender ideology, setting students down a path that can dramatically affect the rest of their lives. A federal judge in Pennsylvania put it this way: “[T]eaching a child how to determine one’s gender identity” strikes “at the heart of parental decision making in a matter of greatest importance in their relationship with their children.” But gender activists in Arizona public schools, however, not only believe they have authority in this area, they deliberately work to keep parents in the dark. The Ganado Unified School District policy, for example, prohibits school staff from disclosing any information regarding a student’s current gender identity, or the steps a school is taking to cater to it, to anyone. The student alone determines his or her gender identity and is in complete control over “when, with whom, and how much to share” even with parents. Mesa schools require not only parental permission, but a “written order” from the appropriate healthcare professional for administration even of over-the-counter medications such as Tylenol. The upshot is that Johnny needs his parents’ permission to go to the zoo, but his parents need his permission to know that he’s undressing in the girls’ locker room. While it’s bad enough that Arizona public schools are taking these steps on their own, the Biden-Harris administration’s Department of Education recently issued a sweeping rule that will push more public school districts in this direction. This massive rule reworks Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in educational programs that receive federal funds. Bureaucrats are using such “rulemaking” to change this important federal law in ways that the Constitution allows only Congress to do. The rule redefines “sex” to include “gender identity”—something Congress certainly did not intend when enacting the law in 1972—and redefines “harassment” so that staff and teachers could face disciplinary action if they “misgender” a student. This massive federal mandate carries the implied threat that billions of dollars in federal funds could be at stake if schools don’t knuckle under and enforce them. By pushing parents aside and imposing the government’s preferred gender ideology, these policies violate parents’ constitutional right to direct the upbringing of their own children. The Supreme Court had called this “perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests” that it has ever recognized. It’s time for parents to fight back against policies in local schools, state laws that allow those policies, and federal rules that promote this agenda at their expense."},

Roberts, PhD, was named President of The Heritage Foundation in October 2021. He succeeded former Heritage President Kay C. James as the seventh President in the organization’s 50-year history. In September 2023, Roberts was named President of Heritage Action for America and serves both organizations in a joint role. Roberts previously served as the Chief Executive Officer of the Texas Public Policy Foundation (TPPF), an Austin-based nonprofit, nonpartisan research institute and the largest state think tank in the nation. Under Roberts’ leadership, TPPF more than doubled in size. He also expanded the Texas think tank’s influence nationwide, opening an office in Washington, D.C., so that TPPF research might better inform federal policy debates. >>> More from Kevin Roberts: The President’s Message As President of The Heritage Foundation, Roberts will continue to lead policy research efforts on many of the issues he championed at TPPF, including education, health care, border security, election integrity, and more, and his leadership will also be critical in pushing back on the radical, socialist agenda being advanced by the Left at all levels of government. At a time when so many bad ideas are coming out of Washington, his experience advancing sound policy at the state and national levels will be vital. “I’m grateful for the opportunity to lead The Heritage Foundation and honored the board selected me as its next President,” Roberts said. “Heritage has led the conservative movement with distinction and its policy solutions have improved the lives of our fellow citizens. I look forward to continuing this legacy and addressing the challenges we face today and in the future. “Heritage is known throughout the conservative movement and policy community as a solutions factory. As a lifelong, movement conservative, I have always seen Heritage as the beacon of conservatism and of the American dream. In recent years, as I have worked with Heritage scholars on several issues, I came to appreciate Heritage’s critical role at this particular point in history. Coming from a state as free and prosperous as Texas, I’m eager to share the innovative ideas we developed and build on them.” A lifelong educator, Roberts earned his PhD in American History from the University of Texas. After several years of teaching history at the collegiate level, Roberts in 2006 left the university to found John Paul the Great Academy, a co-ed, K-12 Catholic liberal arts school in Lafayette, Louisiana. Roberts served as the academy’s president and headmaster for seven years. In 2013, he resigned from the academy to become President of Wyoming Catholic College. Under his leadership, the college adopted a policy of refusing to accept federal student loans and grants, lest it be forced to violate Catholic tenets. This independent stance led The New York Times to describe the school as being full of “cowboy Catholics.” In addition to his doctorate, Roberts holds a master’s degree in History from Virginia Tech and a bachelor’s degree in History from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Roberts and his wife have four children. A nonprofit, nonpartisan research and education institute, The Heritage Foundation is the nation’s premier conservative think tank. It is the most broadly supported think tank in the world, drawing support from more than 500,000 members. Heritage’s policy impact is also unrivaled, with the University of Pennsylvania’s annual report on think tanks recognizing Heritage three years in a row as the think tank with the most significant impact on public policy."},

They would be wrong. The gender activists are in charge, with parents not only denied a role in decisions about such important matters, but increasingly kept in the dark altogether. And it’s about to get worse. A new and sweeping rule by the U.S. Department of Education will push schools even harder to impose the government’s gender ideology on students. Parents can either get on board or be left behind. The Plymouth-Canton Community Schools’ gender policy, like so many others, defines gender identity as a person’s “sense or psychological knowledge of their own gender, which can include being female, male, another gender, or no gender.” Only the individual student, regardless of age, can decide what his or her gender identity is at any particular moment (it can change at any time). That current self-perception drives a host of school policies. The Saline Area Schools’ policy, for example, requires staff to use the individual student’s preferred name and pronouns; allow access to bathrooms, locker rooms, and other facilities and participation in physical education classes and sports “in a manner consistent with (his or her) gender identity.” >>> Public School Gender Policies That Exclude Parents Are Unconstitutional This is, of course, not the only way to look at matters such as gender identity, but the schools have decided, even though this has nothing to do with curriculum or school administration, that it’s their way or the highway. To this end, these policies prohibit informing parents of such radical changes in their children’s lives—at least without the children’s consent. The East Lansing Public Schools’ policy prohibits staff from disclosing information indicating that a student’s “chosen name and pronouns” are different from his or her “birth name or sex assigned at birth” to “third parties including…parents.” It is hard to overstate the implications of deliberately excluding parents from such important matters. Here’s how a federal judge in Pennsylvania put it when parents challenged one of these public-school gender policies: “(T)eaching a child how to determine one’s gender identity” strikes “at the heart of parental decision making in a matter of greatest importance in their relationship with their children.” These parental exclusion policies are in jarring contrast to these same school districts’ policies on far less significant matters. The East Lansing policy, for example, requires that parents be notified before their child participates in surveys on certain topics, written parental consent for medication of any kind, and a written parental permission form “signed by the student’s parent/guardian before being allowed to attend a field trip.” The Ann Arbor Public Schools have the same policy, requiring a “signed permission slip…prior to student participation in any field trip, including walking field trips.” It also requires “written parent permission” to administer any medication, including over-the-counter and even herbal products. Michigan is not alone. More than 18,000 public schools across the country, attended by nearly 11 million students, have adopted such gender policies. >>> The Biden Administration Redefined “Sex”; What Does This Mean for Teachers? The Biden administration’s Department of Education is adding momentum with a new rule reworking Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in educational programs that receive federal funds. It redefines “sex” to include “gender identity”—something Congress certainly did not intend when enacting the law in 1972—and redefines “harassment” so that staff and teachers could face disciplinary action if they “misgender” a student. These new policies are backed up with the implied threat that billions in federal funds could be at stake if schools don’t knuckle under and enforce them. The upshot is that Johnny needs his parents’ permission to visit the zoo, but his parents need Johnny’s permission before even being informed that he’s undressing in the girls’ locker room. By pushing parents aside and imposing the government’s preferred gender ideology, these policies violate the parents’ constitutional right to direct the upbringing of their children. The Supreme Court had called this “perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests” that it has ever recognized. Michigan parents have a lot at stake here. They are not only in the best position to help their children navigate childhood and adolescence, but they have the primary right to do so. With the Biden administration’s backing, public school districts across Michigan are taking that right away from parents and imposing their own gender ideology instead. It’s time for parents to fight back against policies in local schools, state laws that allow those policies, and federal rules that promote this agenda at their expense."},

"], "text": "The role of women in political fights is a tale as old as time. From the Old Testament to the pro-life movement, women have played an indispensable part in crushing the head of the enemy, swaying public opinion, and offering wise guidance. The work of such women is often revealed when godly men abandon their duty to lead and protect those entrusted to them. Perhaps this is one reason why the recent death sentence of Iranian Kurdish civil activist Pakhshan Azizi has sparked widespread protests by human rights activists. Azizi is the third woman, following Wrisha Moradi and Sharifeh Mohammadi, to receive the death penalty for alleged “armed rebellion” in the last month alone. Indeed, in 2023, Iran executed 834 political opponents in hopes of quelling dissent against the Islamic Republic. At least 22 of these prisoners were women, making Iran the country with the highest female execution rate. If current trends continue, this year will be no different. Azizi’s current predicament began in 2009 when she was arrested at Tehran University for protesting the unfair execution of political prisoners. Ironic, right? She was released on bail after four months in detention. Still, the political threats continued. Sensing that Iranian officials had placed a target on her back, she left the country for humanitarian work in Iraq and Syria, where she focused on people displaced by ISIS. Statements from Azizi’s family and legal counsel variously describe her as a humanitarian worker, a journalist, and a lecturer in women’s studies. Azizi’s second, and final, arrest by Iranian authorities occurred in August 2023 when she returned home to visit family. So, what is it about Azizi and other female political prisoners that captures international attention? Perhaps it’s their relative rarity. Many more men than women are executed, at a ratio of 17 to 1. Yet it is the stories of women who suffer due to their social and political engagement that elicit the strongest response. This is because there is a distinct way and reason that women fight compared to men. Yes, women and men are called to work together to further the cultural mandate and the Great Commission. But when women, not men, are at the forefront of the battle or suffer the greatest harm, it suggests that the situation is not only bad but really bad. Azizi’s story, and dozens of women like her in Iran, allow us to reflect on the broader Biblical theme of how women fight, especially when those in authority over them fail. Unlike their male counterparts, wise women of the Bible never grasp a sword to fight, but they are often credited with the victory. They embody tactics such as righteous deception, foresight, wise counsel, strategic use of household objects to crush the head of the enemy, and a loving embrace of marriage, motherhood, and domestic life. Jael is an excellent example of these principles in action. Judges 4–5 describes the day when Jael looked out from her tent and saw Sisera, the commander of the army of King Jabin, Israel’s enemy, stumbling toward her. Faced with the failures of her husband and tribe, who sided against God’s people, Jael called Sisera from afar and entreated him to rest in her tent. Although he asked for water, she deftly gave him milk and a soft place to rest. As soon as he fell asleep, Jael drove a tent peg through his head, swiftly defeating Israel’s enemy. What stands out to me about this story is that when Jael drove the tent peg through the evil commander’s head, she was not in alien territory, as I note in a recent essay for the Eikon journal: “Setting up and taking down tents was a feminine duty; she had likely driven tent pegs into hard patches of earth hundreds, if not thousands, of times before. Jael was not only engaged in political affairs—able to recognize and engage with [Sisera]—but she used foresight and wit to carry out this task in a distinctly feminine manner.” God used her through her daily work—primarily located in the home—to achieve His victory. Similar stories may be told of Deborah, Esther, Ruth, Tamar, the woman of Thebez, and many other wise women of the Bible. Azizi’s family describes her innocence in a similar light. “She has never held a gun,” they said. They added that she went to Syria to serve as a social worker and to volunteer her service there. Despite the failures of Iran’s political regime, Azizi embodied a distinctly feminine form of resistance. She did not take up arms but devoted her life to serving those harmed by a radical regime and reminding those in authority above her of their duty toward their people. That is not armed rebellion—that is telling the truth."},

But as the Court takes up a Tennessee transgender case, Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch has that chance. His fumble came four years ago, when the Court declared in Bostock v. Clayton County that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the federal law that forbids sex discrimination in employment, also bans employment discrimination based on transgender status. Critics have charged that Gorsuch, an avid textualist and the author of the majority opinion, botched his “textual” analysis in that case. But this is a mischaracterization. Instead, Gorsuch botched both the textual analysis and the philosophical analysis. While we agree with Associate Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote in his dissenting opinion that Gorsuch’s opinion was like a “pirate ship ... sail[ing] under a textualist flag,” perhaps the bigger problem with that opinion is that Gorsuch and the justices who joined his opinion wrongly concluded that transgender status and sex are “inextricably” linked. Since then, gender ideologues, activists, and the Biden-Harris administration have weaponized the Court’s holding to force women to share intimate spaces with biological males who identify as women; to force women to compete against those biological males in athletic competition; to compel health insurance plans to pay for gender transition treatments and surgeries; to mandate “preferred pronoun” usage; and to pursue a laundry list of other policies forcing everyday Americans to bend the knee to the new orthodoxy of gender ideology. Even a textualist must sometimes answer philosophical questions, and when those answers are wrong, there are often profound societal consequences. Americans have painfully discovered that in the wake of Bostock. So, what did Justice Gorsuch, the textualist, get wrong? After all, at no point did he conclude that sex and gender identity were the same thing. Here’s what happened. Title VII forbids making certain employment decisions based on a person’s “sex.” Justice Gorsuch rightly assumed that “sex” refers to whether a person is biologically male or female. And he rightly recognized that “sex” and “transgender status” are two different things. But Gorsuch concluded that transgender status was inextricably linked to sex. When noting an employee’s transgender status, an employer will also observe the employee’s underlying sex—something entirely different from how that employee chooses to self-identify. An employer who fires a person for being transgender thus fires a person for having traits—identities, attitudes, or behaviors—tolerated in one sex but not the other. Gorsuch assumed that, all else being equal, the only difference between an employee who identifies as female but was assigned the male sex at birth and an employee who identifies as female and was assigned the female sex at birth is the employee’s sex at birth. If a male who dresses like a female and female who dresses like a female are equally suited to the job, but the male is fired for the way he dresses and identifies, then he was, Gorsuch concluded, terminated “because of... sex”—something Title VII expressly forbids. But claiming to be female based solely on gender identity is not at all like claiming to be female based on sex, that is, based on biological reality. Even the National Institutes of Health explains that gender identity “is not necessarily visible to others,” but is wholly determined by how individuals perceive and interpret their “internal sense” of being male or female. In short, gender is cultural, sex is biological. In reality, the label for one’s sex or gender identity might be the same—“female,” for example—but the term means entirely different things in different contexts. Thus, assuming that an employee’s transgender status was, in fact, the basis for the termination, the employer fired the employee for having a trait not cognizable in either sex—a “gender identity” different from one’s underlying sex. That’s not all. Gorsuch adopted a popular definition of transgender status, something that is rooted in the new and trendy gender ideology, but is incorrect. In saying that sex and gender identity align, Gorsuch may as well have said apples and bananas are the same because they are both fruits. Because sex and gender identity are fundamentally different, they cannot be compared to determine whether they align or not. If that were not enough, Gorsuch also incorrectly referred to sex as being “assigned” and “identified with.” It is neither. One’s sex objectively exists, whether it is recognized or not. By accepting the gender juggernaut’s definition of transgender status, something that conflates sex and gender identity and presumes that sex is either assigned or identified with, Gorsuch bought into a way of thinking about reproductive, bodily, and biological reality that has set the culture on a path to disaster. That literalist approach was precisely the basis for Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s dissent in Bostock. To his mind, Gorsuch got lost in the literal meaning of the text but failed to account for the plain and ordinary meaning of Title VII when read as a whole at the time it was adopted. Gender activists, progressive politicians in Washington, D.C., and cultural elites have used Bostock as the basis of their argument that any law banning sex discrimination also bans transgender status discrimination—something that flies in the face of Bostock’s very limited holding, and something that Justice Alito predicted would be a natural consequence of the Court’s ruling in his blistering dissent. Thankfully, the Supreme Court has, at least thus far, unanimously rejected that argument within the context of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972—the law that bars sex discrimination in federally funded education programs. Title IX permits separate sports teams, bathrooms, locker rooms, and housing accommodations for males and females, so long as both sexes enjoy equal educational opportunities. When the Biden-Harris administration reinterpreted Title IX to mandate nondiscrimination based on gender identity by way of a federal rule finalized and published in April of this year, several states were quick to sue. The Supreme Court unanimously agreed in a per curiam (that is, unsigned) order denying the Biden administration’s request to lift a lower court injunction on its newly minted rule. Now, however, the Court has the chance to repudiate gender ideology wholesale. The Court has decided to hear United States v. Skrmetti, a case in which three minors, their parents, a physician, and the Biden-Harris administration are challenging a Tennessee law that bans transgender medical treatments and surgeries for minors. They claim that the law unconstitutionally discriminates based on “transgender status” in violation of the Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause. As the challengers frame it, under the Tennessee law, a minor whose sex is male and who identifies as male can get testosterone treatments, but a minor whose sex is female but who identifies as male cannot. Thus, discrimination. The Court should reject this argument by recognizing that a person who claims to be female based solely on gender identity is not the same as a person who claims to be female based on sex, that is, based on biological reality. In other words, a person of the female sex is not the same as a person who identifies as female based solely on his self-described gender identity. The Court should also dispense with the language of gender ideology by dropping terms such as “assigning” or “identifying as” a given sex. For millennia, infants have been immediately recognized at birth as being one sex or the other, save for exceedingly rare incidents of sexual development disorders. Short of that, the contagion of gender identity is a poison of relatively nascent propagation. The Supreme Court has the chance to fix a four-year-old mistake, limit the progressive Left’s ongoing effort to expand Bostock’s reach, and recognize (and thereby protect) biological reality while it does so. Let’s hope at least five justices are courageous enough to do just that."},

"], "text": "When it comes to the kind of religious persecution men and women face, a lot depends on one’s biological sex. Just look at Open Door’s World Watch List, which monitors the countries with the highest levels of persecution toward Christians. Its 2024 Gender Report found that, while any faithful Christian may experience persecution throughout his or her life, men and women tend to experience persecution based on the distinct vulnerabilities and nature of their sex. The worst offenders include nations like North Korea, Somalia, Libya, Yemen, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran. For Christian men in these countries, persecution usually happens in public and often through physically violent means. In some of these nations, it is common for these men to suffer torture, public beatings, beheadings, or other forms of public killing. Smaller-scale indignities for men include the loss of their jobs, workplace harassment, or forced recruitment into militia groups. These torments target a man’s ability to protect and provide for his household. For women, religious persecution tends to be more multifaceted, subtle, and private. Perpetrators are often close family members. The most common examples outlined in the report include forced marriages, sexual violence, abduction, and psychological or physical violence. Forced marriages, in particular, can be a powerful cudgel that fathers wield against daughters who convert to Christianity. The report tells the story of one such young woman. After she converted to Christianity, her father locked her in her room for 10 days. “Get ready,” he told her when she was released, “tomorrow you will marry your stepmother’s nephew. I did not raise you right, maybe he will.” Such an act directly targets a woman’s faith, especially since she is expected to identify with the religious worship of her husband. I saw this firsthand on a mission trip to Thailand, where we were ministering to families in the northern mountains. On one visit, our tour guide brought us to the home of a young mother. She was home alone and shared with us that while she had been a Christian for a long time, we were the first believers she had interacted with in years. Each week, her husband required her to worship in the Buddhist temple. If she refused, he threatened to keep her from seeing her children. The religious persecution of women prioritizes intimidation and control rather than more severe and final forms such as death. It targets a woman’s “perceived sexual and familial honor,” the report notes. Open Doors presented this report at the United Nations, which has a special program focused on violence against women. But the idea that certain countries tailor religious persecution to the specific vulnerabilities of men and women was a new idea to me—and not the least bit surprising. In Genesis 3, for example, when God curses Adam and Eve for their sin, verses 16 and 17 use the same root word to describe the “pain” that they will experience. For Eve, this pain is most acute in childbearing, while for Adam it is related to the earth, i.e., his ability to provide. In both cases, this Hebrew word for pain means more than physical pain. It refers to the emotional, mental, and physical pain that, due to sin entering the world, accompanies each aspect of procreation and labor. Men and women are equal in worth and dignity but have distinct biological abilities and vulnerabilities. These include biological differences, of course, as well as our spiritual nature. It’s interesting that at a time when the opinions of the liberal elite seek to dissolve real sex differences, persecutors attend to those differences when they seek to inflict pain. If we ignore the distinct ways that men and women are often persecuted for the sake of so-called gender equality, we not only deceive ourselves but we also limit our ability to serve those who are suffering effectively. For women, whose persecution tends to occur in subtle, multifaceted, and private ways, it will require an additional level of scrutiny for Christians and human rights activists to identify the abuse and intervene on their behalf."},

It’s a common-sense bill that protects minors when the integrity of their bodies and mental health are on the line."], "text": "South Carolina legislation HB 4624 is called the “Help Not Harm” bill—and with good reason. Approved by the House in January, it bans so-called “gender affirming” medical interventions for minors under the age of 18 and prohibits Medicaid coverage of those procedures for anyone under the age of 26. After passing a Senate subcommittee just days ago, the bill now heads to the full Senate Medical Affairs Committee for a vote. Lawmakers there must show the courage of their colleagues in the House because the bill is precisely the kind of legislation that America’s children need—and need immediately. In increasing measure, vulnerable pubescent and pre-pubescent children are being proselytized into a fictional belief that they can be “born in the wrong body.” In fact, so effective have been the influences of social media, peer pressure and pro-trans narratives in this space that UCLA School of Law’s Williams Institute reports that more than 300,000 high school-aged (ages 13-17) children in the United States today identify as “transgender”—making them the largest and fastest-growing share of the overall trans-identified population in the country. >>> The Fight Against Gender Ideology Needs Strong Parents, Leaders, and Laws Between 2017 and 2021, the number of children in the United States taking puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones doubled. And double mastectomies performed on adolescent girls increased by nearly 400% during the same period. These increases aren’t organic. They are a direct result of what appears to be a national social experiment targeting children who are not old enough to vote, get tattoos, buy cigarettes or enter into contracts. The federal government has been working overtime to convince the nation that these experimental procedures are “life-saving care” and that if children don’t have access to these “gender affirming” treatments, they will commit suicide. But the support for such inflammatory rhetoric simply doesn’t exist. We’re being asked to believe that minor children possess the maturity to make life-altering medical decisions and can fully comprehend the risks of these procedures—those that include everything from incontinence to tissue death to lack of fertility, and worse. Nothing could be further from the truth. The increase in a new cohort of the population—de-transitioners—is proof positive of the regretfully life-altering and experimental nature of these kind of “gender affirming” medical interventions. It also demonstrates that children, as easily influenced as they are, must not be used as pawns in a political play that caters to a small but vocal and well-funded minority. >>> States May Protect Minors by Banning “Gender-Affirming Care” This legislation isn’t hateful or bigoted. It’s a common-sense bill that protects minors when the integrity of their bodies and mental health are on the line. It’s also representative of the widespread and bipartisan support for these kinds of bans, as the majority of Americans oppose “gender affirming care” for minors. But the tide is turning. Several European countries that once uncritically embraced “gender-affirming care” for minors have already reconsidered or reversed course as the lack of evidence supporting the safety of these procedures and increasing evidence of long-term complications surfaces. The FDA is being sued for allegedly concealing records regarding the off-label use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones on minors. Medical malpractice claims against hospital systems that rushed minor children into “gender affirming” surgeries with little to no investigation of the minor’s underlying mental health co-morbidities are on the rise. Nearly two dozen states have already enacted laws prohibiting “gender-affirming” interventions for minors in most circumstances. Now is the time for South Carolina to join them."},

"], "text": "Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita has become the latest policymaker shining sunlight on school district actions, and with good reason. Nationwide, school administrators are discovering they might be responsible for eye-popping court settlements if they hide K-12 activities from parents. Consider what happened last summer in California. The Spreckles Union School District settled with a mother who filed suit because educators “socially transitioned” her daughter, who wanted to assume a different so-called gender. District personnel allowed the girl to use the boys’ bathroom and addressed the student by masculine pronouns, all without the parent’s knowledge. District officials settled with the mother for $100,000. Parents have filed similar suits in Michigan, Colorado and Texas over gender-related instruction or activities and parent involvement. Rokita’s office has created an online portal that should protect families and taxpayers from school districts’ secretive policies. Families can submit examples to this site of educational material that other parents may not know children are being presented with in their classrooms. >>> A Fraudulent Attack on Education Choice Already, the portal has a link to one district’s “gender support plan” that instructs educators not to inform parents when their child wants to assume a different gender. A parent has posted an email explaining that her daughters do not want to change clothes with a boy in the girl’s locker rooms. According to the email, the school principal told the students the boy only had to say he was a girl in order to gain access to the facilities. Other submissions are worthy of healthy debate between parents and teachers about the age-appropriateness of materials. One report objected to John Steinbeck’s \"Of Mice and Men,\" Eli Wiesel’s classic Holocaust chronicle \"Night,\" and \"1984\" by George Orwell. While these books have mature themes, educators and parents are responsible for deciding if, how and when to ask students to read books with heavy subjects. They could very well choose other materials, but students will be worse off if topics such as poverty and the American Dream, the Holocaust, and the threats from totalitarianism are left out (or replaced with books on “gender” or critical race theory). Rokita’s project is appropriately elevating conversations about the importance of school content. Rokita’s office says the new website, called “Eyes on Education,” is meant to be a “transparency portal to empower parents to further engage in their children’s education by providing a platform to submit and view potentially inappropriate materials in their schools.” The attorney general said in a press release, “Our kids need to focus on fundamental educational building blocks, NOT ideology that divides kids from their parents and normal society.” In North Carolina, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson created a similar online reporting site for parents, and a task force he assembled released a report on the submissions in 2021. The task force not only found that parents were frustrated by classroom content based on “gender” and with racial bias, but so, too, were teachers. One educator near retirement said they can no longer “trust the values being taught” in classrooms. Another said she was afraid to speak out about the political slant of course content for fear of being fired. >>> School Choice Revolution Helps Homeschoolers, Too Eyes on Education is not Rokita’s first effort to protect parent rights. During the pandemic, his office released a document that lawmakers could use to draft a parent bill of rights for the state. The model bill is a welcome review of citizens’ and parents’ fundamental rights. If Rokita has to remind lawmakers that individuals have a right to speak at school board meetings and parents have a right to make decisions about medical care for a school-aged child, then clearly public school officials have assumed out-sized roles in public policy. Indiana legislators have not used Rokita’s model to full effect yet, though the reports showcased on Eyes on Education and the litigation underway around the country should prompt lawmakers to move. If public school personnel resent the public peering into school curricula, that attitude is evidence there are things to be found. Educators in Indiana—and beyond—should thank him. School personnel are better off if parents know and can comment on what students are being taught before a court forces educators to be more transparent. And as the Spreckles Union School District can attest, it’s certainly less costly."},

Because...trying to circumvent the random assignment of cases “constitutes a threat to the orderly administration of justice.” ", "Apparently, so long as you’re litigating a “woke” cause, anything goes."], "text": "A scathing report by three federal judges on the “misconduct” of plaintiff lawyers in a challenge to Alabama’s ban on gender-transition medicine for minors illustrates something we learned a long time ago: Many on the far left, including radical lawyers employed by self-proclaimed civil rights organizations, believe the ends always justify the means and that rules of ethics don’t apply to them. The report is the result of an investigation into the lawyers who filed three related lawsuits—Walker v. Marshall, Ladinsky v. Ivey, and Eknes-Tucker v. Ivey—challenging Alabama’s Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act in 2022. The state enacted the law that year to eliminate the use of experimental hormonal and surgical procedures on minors who experience discomfort with their biological sex. The final report, issued by three judges representing all three federal court districts in Alabama, was initiated after Judge Liles C. Burke accused the lawyers of judge-shopping to get a particular judge they wanted assigned to the cases. Judge Burke called it “a particularly pernicious form of forum shopping” and “a practice that has the propensity to create the appearance of impropriety in the judicial system.” Ouch! The judges obtained sworn testimony from the 39 plaintiff lawyers who filed these lawsuits. After holding five hearings, they concluded “without reservation” that 11 of the lawyers in the Walker and Ladinsky lawsuits engaged in “misconduct” by attempting to “circumvent the random case assignment procedures” of the Alabama federal courts. The investigation went forward despite some of the lawyers’ claims that the investigation violated their right to due process. >>> School Gender Policies Harm Students and Violate Parents’ Right To Raise Their Children So, what happened after Alabama passed this much-needed statute protecting minors from radically experimental medical interventions, now disfavored among most European nations? The 53-page report goes into great detail: The lawyers tried to avoid the random assignment policy and the assignment of the case to Judge Burke by claiming the cases were related to another case that had been closed “for over a year.” That case, Corbitt v. Taylor, challenged an Alabama law preventing individuals from obtaining a driver’s license listing a gender different from their biological sex unless they could show they had undergone surgical and medical treatments to change their gender. Judge Myron Thompson, a Carter appointee, held, absurdly enough, that the law violated the 14th Amendment. According to the report, the lawyers did everything they could “in an attempt to steer the case to Judge Thompson—including marking the case as supposedly related to Corbitt and calling Judge Thompson’s chambers” to talk to him about the case, even though the case had never been assigned to him. After the case was assigned to Judge Burke, the lawyers dismissed the lawsuits, then refiled almost immediately to get a different judge. The lawyers who engaged in the misconduct include those from the Southern Poverty Law Center, the American Civil Liberties Union, GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders, Lambda Legal and the National Center for Lesbian Rights. Why does this matter? Because, as the report points out, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has said that trying to circumvent the random assignment of cases “constitutes a threat to the orderly administration of justice.” And according to the 5th Circuit, such manipulation brings the “judicial system itself into disrepute” and “permit[s] unscrupulous litigants and lawyers to thwart our system of judicial administration.” >>> SC Is Protecting Its Children With “Help Not Harm” Bill. More States Should Follow The judges went to great lengths to point out the misbehavior of one of the lawyers: Carl Charles, a former Lambda Legal employee who now works at the Justice Department. He was interviewed twice about ex parte phone calls he made (without the knowledge of the defendants’ lawyers) to Judge Thompson’s chambers, the details of which Mr. Charles “reported” to the other lawyers working on the Walker case “via email.” When asked multiple times about these calls, Mr. Charles “unequivocally and repeatedly testified that he did not call [the] judge’s chambers.” It was only after the interviewing judges “read his cell phone number to him” that Mr. Charles suddenly asked if he “could correct his earlier answers and admitted that he did call Judge Thompson’s chambers.” Yes, Mr. Charles—a lawyer who now works for the Department of Justice—lied to the panel of judges under oath until he was confronted with hard evidence that exposed the lie. The question now is whether any of their employers or state bar associations will take any disciplinary action against any of these lawyers. So far, at least, there is no indication that the Justice Department, the private firms, the advocacy organizations or state bar authorities have done so. Apparently, so long as you’re litigating a “woke” cause, anything goes."},

The Department’s persecution of pro-life advocates, praying grandmothers, and fathers of young children under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (while routinely ignoring arson and vandalism at crisis pregnancy centers chargeable under the same law) is hard to deny. But the Department’s meritless criminal prosecution of Dr. Eithan Haim, a whistleblowing physician who exposed covert gender medicine procedures inflicted on minors at Texas Children’s Hospital—performed in violation of state law—is an outrageous abuse of its law enforcement authority. The principal wrongdoer in Dr. Haim’s case—leading the charge in his criminal prosecution for alleged violation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”)—is Assistant United States Attorney Tina Ansari, a Democratic donor who targeted Haim in part during a time when her law license had been suspended by the Texas Bar for failure to pay her bar dues. As legal scholar Ed Whelan has correctly pointed out, the only reason Haim was targeted was because “he ran afoul of the transgender ideology that dominates” the current presidential administration. But now, in pleadings filed by Dr. Haim’s lawyers and in separate complaints filed by a former DOJ lawyer with both the State Bar of Texas and the Justice Department’s Office of Professional Responsibility, Ansari is accused of having “knowingly sponsored false information” to the federal grand jury that indicted Haim and of having “knowingly misled a tribunal and presented deliberately misleading information to a grand jury.” In other words, she wasn’t just practicing law on a suspended license. She is charged with lying to the grand jury to get Haim indicted—itself a violation of federal law. As journalist Christopher Rufo reported, Dr. Haim knew the hospital “secretly continued to perform transgender medical interventions, including the use of implantable puberty blockers, on minor children” after it assured the public it was no longer engaging in such medically dangerous and risky actions. Haim did not disclose the name of any patients, or any personally identifiable medical information protected by federal law under HIPAA (42 U.S.C. §§1320d-6). The Justice Department didn’t care. It charged Haim with criminally violating HIPAA anyway, arguing that he had disclosed “individually identifiable health information,” something explicitly prohibited by HIPAA. The punishment for such a conviction? Up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The original grand jury indictment claimed he had obtained HIPAA-protected patient medical information through “false pretenses.” Haim had, allegedly, accessed the medical records after he completed his surgical rotation at Texas Children’s Hospital in January 2021 and had no more patients there. But, according to the ethics complaints and a motion for grand jury material filed by Haim’s lawyers, Haim did still have patients at the hospital, and Ansari and other government prosecutors knew it. That would have made his access of patient records entirely legal under HIPAA. The hospital provided records to the government showing that Haim continued to treat patients at the hospital after his residency was over, during the time when the grand jury indictment claims he wasn’t treating any patients and had no legal right to access patient records. All of this is also apparent in a “Superseding Indictment” Ansari filed on Oct. 10 that, as the defense points out, deletes all references to Haim accessing patient records when he was supposedly no longer treating patients at the hospital. Yet the new indictment still claims he obtained those records under “false pretenses.” As a result, Haim’s lawyers asked the court to provide them with access to all of the materials the grand jury considered when it issued the original indictment. Why? Because the documents would likely show that the hospital told Ansari that Haim was continuing to treat patients at the hospital when she was making presentations to the grand jury claiming the opposite. Grand jury materials are secret under applicable federal rules of criminal procedure. But the grand jury materials should be released in this case, says Haim’s lawyers, under the exceptions provided in the rules, to determine if the government “knowingly” sponsored “false information before the grand jury” and if that false information was “capable” of “influencing the grand jury’s decision.” The lawyers are right when they tell the court that if “the government has made material misleading statements to the grand jury, the defense should be permitted to review the relevant grand jury material.” Haim has also filed a “Show Cause” motion asking the court to issue an order against Ansari for “engaging in the practice of law with a suspended law license.” The motion says she was administratively suspended on Sept. 1 for not paying her bar dues. She responded that she remedied this problem as of Sept. 19. But as Haim’s attorneys point out, Ansari was signing and filing pleadings in the case during her suspension, which violates the Texas Code of Professional Conduct, the court’s own rules, and the internal rules of the Justice Department that direct DOJ lawyers to immediately cease their representation of the government during such a lapse. Not surprisingly, Ansari is a big donor to Democrat candidates, having contributed a total of $11,350, which is quite a bit of money for a career civil service employee. Mind you, there is nothing illegal about those donations, but as the complaint filed against her with the Office of Professional Responsibility at DOJ states, it raises serious questions on whether “her specific ideological or political view as it related to the highly controversial issues in this prosecution” biased her judgment and prompted her to mislead a federal grand jury. The pursuit of Dr. Haim is simply outrageous. As one of Haim’s principal lawyers, Marcella Burke, told us, “DOJ has charged Dr. Haim with a non-existent crime. At a charitable minimum, this is a reckless prosecution and at its extreme, it is malicious prosecution.” The fact that the indictment hasn’t been dropped indicates what’s really going on here. Because Haim didn’t release any personal medical information about any patient, something HIPAA prevents, the new indictment now charges him with allegedly acting to “cause malicious harm” to the hospital and its physicians. And what is the “malicious harm” Haim caused? Apparently, the Justice Department believes that he inflicted “malicious harm” by letting the public know that a children’s hospital was lying when it claimed it was no longer inflicting transgender medical abuse on its minor patients and that the hospital was violating Texas law. That is a prosecution based on politics and ideology, not the law and the interests of justice or, for that matter, of the public at large. While the prosecution continues against Dr. Haim, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has launched an investigation into Texas Children’s Hospital for performing gender “affirming” medicine in violation of state law. The Lonestar State has outlawed hormone replacement therapy for minors and other forms of “gender-affirming care,” if that type of mistreatment can be called “care.” AG Paxton has warned that “doctors who continue to provide these harmful ‘gender transition’ drugs and treatments will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.” If his claim is true, Dr. Haim should be praised for exposing wrongdoing at Texas Children’s Hospital. Instead, he faces a federal criminal indictment. Sadly, the U.S. Justice Department’s view of law enforcement now appears to be driven by politics, not justice."},

"], "text": "If you’re the parent of a child in a Pennsylvania school facing disciplinary problems, the law says you must be notified. The same goes if your child is caught with drugs or alcohol. But if your child is questioning his or her gender, you won’t hear a word. In fact, many school districts have adopted policies deliberately designed to keep you in the dark. There’s little dispute that, in general, schools should take the lead on matters such as curriculum or school administration. Sex and gender identity, however, are in a different category altogether. A federal judge in Pennsylvania put it this way: “[T]eaching a child how to determine one’s gender identity” strikes “at the heart of parental decision making in a matter of greatest importance in their relationship with their children.” >>> Public School Gender Policies That Exclude Parents Are Unconstitutional All kids play dress-up or make-believe. So did we, once upon a time. But we did not insist that schools cater to our imaginations and structure policies around them. Yet when it comes to gender identity, for some reason, things are much different today. The Abington School District’s gender policy defines gender identity as “a person’s sense of what gender(s), if any, with which they identify.” And this belief, a child’s self-identification can change at any time. School gender policies require that a child’s current internal “sense” at any given moment dictates school policy on a host of matters. The Derry Township School District’s policy, for example, requires school personnel to address students “by the name and pronouns that correspond to their gender identity.” The School District of Philadelphia policy requires that schools eliminate “all gender-based activities, rules, policies and practices” that do not have “a clear and sound pedagogical purpose.” Even then, students may ignore that purpose and participate in any activities or follow “any such rule, policy, or practice consistent with their gender identity.” Under the School District of Pittsburgh policy, students must have access to “all restrooms, locker rooms, changing facilities, or overnight facilities…that correspond to their gender identity.” The same is required for physical education classes and intramural sports. But what’s more, these policies deliberately conceal information from parents about their own children. The Colonial School District policy is typical, prohibiting school personnel from disclosing any gender-related information “to others, including the student’s parents/guardians…unless the student has authorized such disclosure.” These parental exclusion policies are in jarring contrast to how the same schools handle far less significant matters. Philadelphia public schools, for example, require written parental permission for any student to go on a field trip or to receive any medication, including over-the-counter products. Pittsburgh public schools do too, but exclude non-prescription throat lozenges from needing parental consent. The upshot is that Johnny needs his parents’ permission to visit the zoo, but his parents need Johnny’s permission before even being informed that he’s undressing in the girls’ locker room. Pennsylvania public schools are not alone. Nearly 1,100 school districts across the country, with 11.5 million students attending 19,600 schools, have already joined the gender revolution. And it’s about to get worse. A sweeping new rule by the Biden administration’s Department of Education will push schools even harder to impose the government’s gender ideology on students. Parents can either get on board or be left behind. This rule reworks Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in any educational program that directly or indirectly receives federal funds (which is the vast majority of schools in the country). The rule redefines “sex” to include “gender identity or expression”—something Congress certainly did not intend when enacting the law in 1972—and redefines “harassment” so that staff and teachers could face disciplinary action if they “misgender” a student. This massive federal mandate carries the implied threat of revocation of billions in federal funds if schools don’t knuckle under and enforce it. By pushing parents aside and imposing the government’s preferred gender ideology, these policies violate the parents’ constitutional right to direct the upbringing of their children. The Supreme Court had called this “perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests” that it has ever recognized. It’s time for parents to fight back against these policies in local schools, oppose state laws that allow those policies, and speak out against federal rules that promote this agenda at their own expense."},

President Joe Biden’s administration has approved a new federal rule that redefines sex to mean “sexual orientation and gender identity,” divorcing biology from American law. The rule endangers women and girls, and shatters civil rights—but it also gives Christians a chance to apply crucial ethical principles to public policy. The new rule changes Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972—which has guaranteed sex equality in education for more than 50 years—to now allow a man who says he “feels” like a woman to use females’ private spaces, including bathrooms and locker rooms. If he is prevented from doing so, he could file a federal complaint. This poses an obvious danger to women. Whistleblowers have already turned up examples of assaults in public school bathrooms and injuries to young women on athletic fields when they competed against boys. As matters of civil rights and personal safety, believers should oppose the rule. >>> The Biden Administration Redefined “Sex”; What Does This Mean for Teachers? Christians have ethical concerns, too, because redefining a word that is central to creation order has far-reaching consequences. God created humanity as man and woman with unique differences, namely the ability to produce sperm or eggs. Anomalies happen, but do not change the rule. “Gender,” as the radical theorists will tell you, is an idea—something that “is in no way a stable identity,” says theorist Judith Butler. Gender theorists say any claim to biological distinctions is a form of oppressive power. In this way, gender challenges God’s Word and argues that Genesis did not declare God’s authority but merely made suggestions. Ethically, this is a “normative” problem, and believers should ask what God’s Word says about a specific moral question. The gender movement has simplified this equation for Christians by challenging Biblical authority. Following Scripture over a “feeling” resolves the normative issue. But the scholarship on Christian ethics, particularly the work of John Frame, includes another dimension: Believers should ask, “What is our goal for civil society?” How can we change the world to bring glory to God? For this, Christ followers can look to state officials who are challenging the Biden administration’s rule in court. Legal officials representing 26 states have filed a bevy of lawsuits to stop the redefinition of sex in federal law. State attorneys general and governors have spoken out against the rule, citing administrative problems, free-speech violations, threats to women’s rights, and more. Education officials in states such as Louisiana and South Carolina have said educators should not apply the new rule in K-12 schools. >>> School Gender Policies Harm Students and Violate Parents’ Right To Raise Their Children Believers should support these efforts. The Biden administration is challenging God’s created design, and God did not award the state normative authority. He allows civil powers to rule, even uses them for His purposes, but He does not grant them the right to overturn His Word—which is why Christians must choose a situational response. Lawsuits to stop the rule are not vengeful actions but are meant to protect vulnerable individuals. A man who chooses to dress as a woman does not have the right to undress in front of a little girl. Data reveal that many of these individuals are wrestling with issues that underlie their “gender” choices, and, among young people, the confusion often resolves as they enter adulthood. Studies find that we do not know enough about the long-term consequences of puberty-blocking and hormone-altering medicines to say the treatments are safe. A recent bombshell report from England’s chief pediatrician said their use was built on a “shaky foundation.” Equating sex with gender, then, is not an act of mercy to fellow sinners. This is the response from the third ethical component, the redemptive or existential side. Research finds a startling overlap between individuals who are confused about their sex and those with mental health issues. Not all “trans” individuals suffer from psychosis but helping them with their symptoms of depression and anxiety, for example, are ways to display compassion. That is how we can redemptively show God’s love to sexually confused people. We do not extend God’s love by encouraging them to embark on risky procedures, nor are we merciful by redefining His Word. The Biden administration’s rule undercuts God’s authority, and ethically, Christians have normative Biblical reasons to resist."},

"], "text": "The history of feminism began where it is most likely to end: with a man. In 1837, French philosopher and ill-reputed utopian socialist Charles Fourier coined the term “feminist” to describe his belief in the equality of men and women.[1] This may seem unremarkable, especially today, but taken in the larger context of his political philosophy, the foundational errors of the feminist movement emerge. Fourier believed that the institution of marriage was inherently oppressive to women—vowing to never marry himself—instead, encouraging men and women to explore their array of sexual desires, including those for the same sex. He spent most of his time, however, articulating a proto-communist vision of society where all laborers, men and women, were organized into productive labor units and goods were shared in common. Fydor Dostevisky, for example, criticized Fourier multiple times throughout his novel Demons: Fourier’s ideas, such as a loose sexual morality, a tendency toward socialism, and the devaluation of the traditional family, continue to influence the political and social themes articulated by the feminist movement today. Feminism’s Patriarchs It is easy to identify many of the prominent feminist women throughout history—Mary Wollstonecraft, Betty Friedan, and Judith Butler—yet it is men, beginning with Charles Fourier, who have directed many of feminism’s key developments. Indeed, what is often called “feminism” cannot be separated from ideologically driven men who saw an opportunity to take advantage of or to cultivate detached and vulnerable women ripe for redirection toward their own social and political goals. Scholars have found it helpful to delineate between First-Wave (1848–1920), Second-Wave (1960–1970), and Third-Wave (1992–present) feminism when studying the evolution in beliefs and issues in the so-called march for women’s equality. Few scholars, however, have focused on the men who shaped each wave of feminine reaction and response to the prevailing cultural, familial, and religious mores. Since man acts upon history and woman adorns his handiwork, the Christian student ought to look for men in the pages of the feminist history, both as a catalyst of reaction, and also as the germination for their destructive ideas. From the men promoting free-love during first-wave feminism, the moguls concerned with depopulation in the second-wave, and the transgender influencers in third-wave feminism, each required the buy-in of women to succeed. >>> Trans Athlete Injures Multiple Girls, Forcing Team To Forfeit. Wither Thou, Feminism? This exploration into the depths of feminist lore does not strip woman of agency or blame man for the actions of woman. Quite the opposite. Woman is as free an agent as man and has a salvific role in the redemptive work in creation (cf. 1 Tim. 2:15). Furthermore, man cannot be effective in the political arena without her support. In the same way that woman completes man’s work in creation (Gen. 2:18), she is a force of destruction when turned toward the wrong ends (Prov. 14:1). For precisely these reasons, men have twisted the natural role and work of women under the guise of female empowerment, to gain the support of women for their own immoral or foolish efforts. Over time, a movement that claimed to strive for equality between men and women unmasked itself as a movement that sought to make women like men, and even deny the reality of meaningful biological differences altogether. While this is obvious in second-wave and third-wave feminism, these beliefs were present from the beginning of first-wave feminism, too. The Men of First-Wave Feminism (1848–1920) The personal lives of the first-wave feminists—men and women alike—show us the natural outcome of their ideas. Scholars often credit Mary Wollstonecraft, author of the Vindication of the Rights of Women, as the first feminist thinker.[3] Other prominent first-wave feminists include Lucretia Coffin Mott, Susan B. Anthony, and Elizabeth Cady Stanton of Seneca Falls and “The Declaration of Sentiments.” At the level of abstract theory, these thinkers posited an egalitarian vision of the relationship between the sexes in the public sphere—the right to vote, own property, and be ordained pastors—and in the private sphere, decrying the total authority fathers and husbands had over their wives and their children. In practice, however, they tended to promote a vision of men and women as independent of and from each other, free to pursue their own interests. In her book, The End of Woman,[4] Carrie Gress explores the untold stories of first-wave feminism.[5] She challenges the long-held assumption that first-wave feminism was net-positive for women, while second-wave feminism veered off course with the inclusion of abortion and hormonal contraception. Most importantly, Gress reveals the men behind the First Wave and their role in shaping its women. The men of first-wave feminism—including Edward Wollstonecraft, William Godwin, and Percy Shelley—each took advantage of vulnerable women, thus shaping these early feminists’ thoughts about marriage, childbearing, and the desire for a revolutionary change in the class and sex structure of society. Mary Wollstonecraft’s view of marriage, for example, was greatly influenced by her father, Edward, and his nightly abuse of her mother. Despite Mary’s attempts to mediate between her parents, her mother seemed resigned to the situation and did little to rectify it. Mary left home as soon as she could, and eventually had children with two men whom she never married. Mary’s second partner, William Godwin, shared her disdain for marriage as a bondage for men and women alike. Mary’s personal life is a tragic tale. Her first lover abandoned her not long after she gave birth to their first child; she attempted suicide multiple times; and not long after meeting William Godwin, she began bearing his children, too. Unfortunately, Mary died ten days after the birth of their second daughter from complications. Godwin later married a neighbor to help raise both their children. Undoubtedly, these experiences greatly influenced Mary Wollstonecraft’s own books about the role of men and women in society, which formed the philosophical foundation of first-wave feminism. Despite Godwin’s outspoken support for non-monogamous commitments, he was displeased when his own daughter followed in his footsteps. Mary Godwin, Mary Wollstonecraft’s final child, met and fell in love with the infamous poet and playboy Percy Shelley when she was only fourteen years old. Despite Percy’s own marriage and child with another woman, Mary and Percy ran away together two years later, prompting the suicide of his wife. Percy’s radical views about a free and open expression of love without the limitations of marriage harken back to Charles Fourier’s vision of a feminist society. Percy considered himself, and other like poets, “the unacknowledged legislators of the world.”[6] Percy cast his vision of a feminist future in his infamous novel, later called The Revolt of Islam, about the ideal woman.[7] Percy names this woman Cythna, and he depicts her as truly independent, sexless, and unattached from marriage, procreation, religion, and cultural expectations. Cyntha was “free” to live as she pleased with no consequences for her sexual or moral forays. Of course, the reality is far grimmer. As Mary Shelley’s own life testifies, women and children suffer while men like Percy Shelley benefit from this liberated lifestyle. During their brief marriage, Percy had many affairs with other women, gaining an unwelcome reputation everywhere they went. Mary herself gave birth to four children and had one miscarriage with Percy, although only one child survived until adulthood. This hardship has led many scholars to read Frankenstein as a story about the limitations of technology to overcome the harsh realities of sex, childbearing, and the need for unconditional love. By 1848, it was clear to many women that neither the current legal situation, nor the promise of a liberated lifestyle from revolutionaries such as Percy Shelley, were sufficient to gain women the rights they desired. Such women prematurely concluded that men, either due to their failure to lead or their guidance into marital open borders, could not be trusted to offer a solution. It is with this backdrop that Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote the Declaration of Sentiments for the Seneca Falls Convention, the first feminist gathering and declaration of independence from men.[8] In the same style as her contemporary Shelley, Stanton frames the relationship between men and women as “a long train of abuses and usurpations . . . under absolute despotism” and calls women to “throw off such government, and to provide new guards for their future security.”[9] The abuses that Stanton lists include: Clearly, many of the abuses listed here were a source of great heartache for women. The right to pursue higher education, professional interests, and play an active role in politics is one that many women, myself included, have benefited from greatly. But in some cases, the liberated laws we have today have swung so far in the opposite direction that they harm men: no-fault divorce has enabled 70% of all divorces[11] to be initiated by women—90% for women with a bachelor’s degree or higher[12]—and changes in family law mean that, with few exceptions, women receive de facto custody of their children. Many of the other concerns noted, however, seem more directed at nature itself. For example, laws permitting abortion or hormonal contraception aim to liberate women from the duties of motherhood and childbearing. Still, these artificial attempts to change nature fail to do so, and only further harm both men, women, and unborn children. Stanton’s assumption, that women are necessarily oppressed by men, led to a false conclusion that the best alternative was for women to free themselves from men altogether. In their attempt to free themselves from men, these women also alienated themselves from the gifts and duties of womanhood. Such unattached and vulnerable women soon found themselves further manipulated by the men of second-wave feminism, who like Fourier and Shelley, used feminism to gain the support for women for their own revolutionary ends. The Men of Second-Wave Feminism (1960–1970s) It is not until the technological advancements of second-wave feminism that Percy Shelley’s Cythna—a sexless creature with no maternal or familial duties—could become a reality. Second-wave feminism, which is synonymous with the sexual revolution, created a culture and policies that encouraged contraception, abortion, hook-up culture, and no-fault divorce. Proponents include Ms. Magazine’s Gloria Steinem, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Betty Friedan of the Feminine Mystique, and Angela Davis of the Black Panthers. As in first-wave feminism, many of the defining issues of second-wave feminism are the result of top-down efforts by well-funded men, such as John D. Rockefeller III, Hugh Hefner, and the advocacy group originally named the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws (NARAL), which was formed by three men. This time, their goals went beyond attempts to abolish marriage and focused on their efforts to depopulate the United States and normalize sexual promiscuity. In 1970, Richard Nixon’s administration established the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future. Concern about overpopulation spurred on by Paul R. Ehrlich’s erroneous book The Population Bomb, animated conversations about how to reduce the birth rate. Chairman John D. Rockefeller III (1970–1972) was particularly concerned with this problem, and after a two-year review period, he offered a list of startling recommendations to solve the problem.[13] Nixon, to his credit, rejected these recommendations, but they still made their way into public policy. Rockefeller III’s recommendations included the passage of an Equal Rights Amendment, abortion-on-demand for all, hormonal contraception access for all, the removal of home economics courses or sex-specific education in high school, and a messaging emphasis that encouraged women to delay marriage and motherhood in favor of higher education and a full-time career. Rockefeller III recognized that to make his recommendations salient, he would need to gain the buy-in of women. Feminism provided the best conduit to do this. As Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman elected to Congress and influential feminist, argued in her remarks to the Republican Task Force on Earth Resources and Population, Similarly, Hugh Hefner, the founder of the pornographic magazine Playboy (1953) and the owner of the Playboy Mansion, benefited from the feminist movement’s liberalization of sexuality. Hefner considered himself a liberator of women and a feminist throughout his life, promoting his work to women under this banner. It is not difficult to imagine how grafting his pornographic and promiscuous lifestyle onto feminism benefited his own career, at the expense of women. In many ways, Hefner is a less talented, but equally corrupt, version of Percy Shelley. His ideas, through the promise of a riveting lifestyle and artistic depictions of pornography, sought to capture the imagination, and participation, of women for his own benefit. It should come as no surprise, then, that a small group of men were behind the inclusion of abortion as a core feminist issue. In 1969, an all-male formation committee launched the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Law (NARAL). (The pre-formation planning committee included Lawrence Lader of New York, Garrett Hardin of California, and Dr. Lonny Myers of Chicago.) Feminists were originally divided over the issue of abortion, but once NARAL gained the support of Betty Friedan, who helped run the National Organization for Women (NOW), there was no going back. Of course, children are the ones who pay the ultimate price. In Percy Shelley’s life, many of his own children died from the lack of proper care that they, and their mothers, received, given Percy’s demands for travel and back-to-back births. Similarly, Hefner’s sexual revolution benefited from abortion’s “get out of jail” free card at the cost of many unborn lives. The sexual revolution and the introduction of reproductive technologies into second-wave feminism further alienated women, and by extension men, from their own bodies. As the unified bond of marriage, sex, and procreation was torn apart by an emphasis on pleasure apart from sexuality, a far more pervasive social trend took root: the emphasis on gender—an internal sense of self—over biological sex. Feminism, which has downplayed the reality of biological sex since its inception, now enters a collision course with itself as biological sex comes into conflict with radical gender ideologies. The Men of Third-Wave Feminism (1992–Present) “The confusion surrounding what constitutes third-wave feminism is in some respects its defining feature.”[15] Despite the incoherence of this statement—a house divided against itself cannot stand—feminist scholar Elizbeth Evans highlights feminisms’ collision course with itself that third-wave feminism reveals. For many feminists, such as J.K. Rowling, feminism is inherently at odds with the transgender movement. A growing number of “TERFs,” or “Transgender Exclusionary Radical Feminists,” aim to protect “true” feminism—equality for women—from gender theorists such as Judith Butler, whose feminism—equality for all genders—tends to harm women and children. Despite the unlikely alliance that has emerged between many TERFs and social conservatives in defending the importance of biological sex, the transgender movement is not a deviation from feminism per se. Indeed, it is the fruit of a consistent philosophical movement from Charles Fourier, Percy Shelley, and Hugh Hefner to Dylan Mulvaney. The devaluation of biological sex for higher ideals has taken on flesh as the transgender movement prioritizes gender—an internal sense of self—over biological sex. The men of third-wave feminism are easier to spot than ever before. In this upside-down world, they are reasserting their dominance by masquerading as women with legal or social support. Obvious examples include “Caitlin” Jenner, “Lia” Thomas, Dylan Mulvaney, and\n“Rachel” Levine. The cultural deference that many liberal and feminist women pay to these men led my colleague Delano Squires to joke that “the country’s most powerful women finally found a group of men they can submit to.”[16] As the social hierarchy shifted, many of the men who now identify as women saw a chance for advancement under the confused banner of feminism. Bruce Jenner, for example, was a star decathlete in the 1970s, but had become a mid-level celebrity with a drunk driving death on his record. After his so-called transition to a woman, he became an overnight cultural icon and received Glamour’s 2015 Woman of the Year Award. Similarly, Dylan Mulvaney was a C-list Hollywood actor with some minor sitcoms to his name before he transformed himself into an online sensation and influencer with his “Days of Girlhood” TikTok videos. Within athletics, William Thomas ranked in the 400’s among male collegiate swimmers. With little hope of reaching the top tier among male athletes, Thomas began to identify as Lia and compete in the women’s category. Overnight, he began setting time records and tied for first place with Riley Gaines in the NCAA’s 200-yard freestyle championship in 2022. Similarly, Adam Levine’s transition to Rachel enabled him to hold distinctions as both a “transgender” person and as a woman. For example, as the National Women’s History Museum explains, Levine’s confirmation as the 17th Assistant Secretary for Health in 2021 gave him the distinction of the “highest-ranking openly transgender government official in U.S. history.”[17] Later the same year, Levine “was sworn in as a four-star admiral in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps . . . [and is the] highest-ranking member and its first-ever female four-star admiral.”[18] These honors, which distinguish him above other men and women, make a mockery of the achievements of women. Moreover, as with each previous wave, women pay the price for this fraudulent replacement of womanhood. Each of these men inhabited the loathed “straight, white, and male” category. But they found a place of distinction, and cultural dominance, in the transgender movement. Men of third-wave feminism are much like Percy Shelley or Hugh Hefner. Such men, behind each wave of feminism, manipulated women for their own benefit by teaching women to ignore their natural inclination toward marriage, sex, and procreation. The Jael Generation The dangers of evil men and foolish women, who find themselves reduced to sexless animals in their attempt to gain power and domination over the other, leave us with a lasting question: How should the wise woman respond? In many instances, women faced legitimate wrongs, failures, or a loss of meaning that drove them to act. Unfortunately, many of their “solutions,” divided from virtuous guidance and structure, only made the problem worse. There are three recurring ways women respond to spiritual, economic, and moral separation from godly men: So, how should women respond when men prey upon women or abdicate their role as moral and spiritual leaders? Thankfully, the answer is within our grasp. The ultimate battle is not between the sexes, but against the seed of the serpent. We need a “Jael Generation” of women who act with righteous cunning, foresight, and hospitality, who can offer wise counsel to those around them. As many of the wise women of Scripture teach us by their example, this accountability begins with their husbands or fathers and extends outwards into society, even reaching the high priest or king. Such wise women never pick up the sword to fight, nor do they seek to replace the men in authority, and yet they often are credited with the victory. So, how did these wise women of the Bible act in response to the failures of men or their nation? Righteous Cunning In Genesis 3, the serpent deceived Eve, and the whole creation fell under the curse of sin. In the very passage where God judges’ creation, he declares the protoevangelium to the serpent: “I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel” (Gen. 3:15). In this promise, the first Gospel proclamation, God empowers subsequent women to destroy the head(s) of the serpent(s) that threaten God’s redemptive work in the world. Rather than mimicking men, wise women in the Bible fight for and through their offspring with the very tool that once caused the downfall of humanity: righteous cunning. In the stories of the Woman of Thebez and Jael, they used millstones and tent pegs (traditionally feminine and household objects) to deliver carefully aimed, deadly blows to the heads of adversaries. Tamar and Rahab employed righteous cunning to fulfill the promises of God when those in authority over them failed to act faithfully. Similarly, the Egyptian midwives deceived Pharaoh and refused to kill newborn Hebrew boys. In each instance, God does not condemn this use of righteous cunning. He blesses each of these women with families of their own, including some in the lineage of Jesus Christ. Foresight Faced with the failures of her husband and tribe, who sided against the nation of Israel, Jael embodies the power of daily faithfulness in one’s duties. In Judges 4–5, we meet Jael after her husband Heber the Kenite allied with Jabin, King of the Canaanites, during their war with Israel. One day, as she looked out from her tent, she saw Jabin stumbling toward her. Recognizing the King and the opportunity before her, she called to him from afar and entreated him to rest in her tent. Although he asked for water, she deftly gave him milk and a soft place to rest. >>> Feminism in the Dock As soon as he fell asleep, she drove a tent peg through his head, swiftly defeating Israel’s enemy. What is so notable about this story is that when Jael drove the tent peg through the evil king’s head, she was not deviating from her normal life. Setting up and taking down tents was a feminine duty; she had likely driven tent pegs into hard patches of earth hundreds, if not thousands, of times before. Jael was not only engaged in the political affairs of Israel—able to recognize and engage with the king—but that she used foresight and wit to carry out this task in a distinctly feminine manner. Hospitality Esther’s story has an aspect of righteous deception as she conceals her true identity from the king. She uses a courageous form of hospitality by approaching the King uncalled for—an act punishable by death—and inviting him and Hamon to not one, but two feasts. Here she wins the king’s favor and reveals the evil plan of Hamon to destroy the Jewish people. Similarly, Lady Wisdom in Proverbs 8 describes herself as one who prepares a feast—with homemade bread and wine she brewed—to invite the simple and those in need of wisdom to learn from her ways. Here the faithful preparation of a feast reflects the inner self-discipline of these women who can bide their time to not only hold men accountable but do so in the way that is most likely to be successful. Wise Counsel The Old Testament describes the period of the Judges as one where few men were faithful in their work, such that faithful women were raised up in their place. Deborah, a prophetess of Israel, offered wise counsel to the leaders of Israel throughout this time. When Barak in Judges 4 failed to lead his army against Sisera, Deborah called him out for his disobedience to the Lord. Similarly, many women throughout the Bible play the role of negotiator or counselor, especially when the men in authority act with foolishness or neglect. The Bible describes Abigail, King David’s eventual wife, the Wise Woman of Tekoa, and the Wise Woman of Abel Beth Maacah as intervening on behalf of their family and city to preserve their life and form an alliance with God’s people when their husbands or city leaders failed to act with wisdom. Each of these women, in their times, places, and contexts, embody the teachings of Lady Wisdom from Proverbs 8 and throughout the Bible. The archetypal figure of Lady Wisdom instructs the simple, faithfully manages her household, prepares feasts, and calls many to imitate her ways. She was present at the beginning of the world, and in 1 Corinthians 1:24, Paul describes Jesus Christ as the “wisdom of God.” Thus, each woman who embodies the teachings of Lady Wisdom finds her ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ, the King and Savior of the world. Conclusion The complicated history of feminism, beset by ideologically driven men who saw an opportunity to take advantage of or to create unattached and vulnerable women, meets its match in the Jael Generation. Such women may challenge men or institutions when they are wrong, encourage them when they are weak, and provide wise counsel along the way. It is only then that women will find a life-giving alternative to the false promises of feminism and play their part in empowering a generation of men who lead with honor, truth, and care for those entrusted to them.

More than 11.5 million students already attend 20,000 schools with these policies. If the Biden administration had its way, Georgia schools would soon join them. Look at a few typical policies from Virginia. The Arlington County Public School policy defines gender identity as “one’s sense of self as male, female, or an alternative gender.” These policies assume that every student, regardless of age, has this “sense of self” and require that any expression of it be taken at face value, treated as conclusive, and drive a host of other policies. The Chesapeake Public Schools policy requires access to facilities, such as bathrooms and locker rooms, “that correspond to a student’s gender identity.” Students may “participate in any co-curricular or extracurricular activity,” dress, and have the “right to be addressed in class and in the school building” consistent with their gender identity. The First Amendment or privacy rights of other students and teachers be hanged. The Fairfax County Public Schools policy provides that students be assigned “to a room consistent with the student’s gender identity” during activities that require “students to be accommodated overnight.” No word on what to do about students uncomfortable with being paired with an opposite-sex roommate. The Hampton City Schools policy states that it has “no affirmative legal duty to inform parents of the student’s gender identity choice.” In other words, parents are shut out unless the student gives permission. The upshot of these policies is that Johnny may need his parents’ permission to go to the zoo with his class, but the parents often need Johnny’s permission to know about him undressing in the girls’ locker room. Before you say this won’t happen in Georgia, consider this. Title IX is the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in educational programs that receive federal financial assistance. That’s almost every public school (and many private ones) in America. Title IX has opened up incredible opportunities for women and girls. The Department of Education recently released a mammoth “rule” that redefines “sex” to include gender identity. There’s no way Congress meant to prohibit discrimination based on a “sense of self as … an alternative gender” when it enacted Title IX in 1972. Congress said sex, and Congress meant sex — the objective distinction between male and female. If Congress wanted to include the radically different concept of gender identity, Congress could do so. It hasn’t. As civics teachers in schools across the country should still be explaining, the legislative branch, not the executive branch, makes the law. Here’s why this matters for Georgia schools. The federal government provides billions in education aid to states and conditions that cashflow on compliance with laws such as Title IX. So, pressure to cave in and jump on the gender identity bandwagon is coming from the gender activists and the feds. Parents in Georgia are in danger of getting squeezed out, and they should be concerned. These gender policies have nothing to do with curriculum or administration, areas where schools are given wide latitude. Instead, they have everything to do with matters at the heart of family relationships and parents’ right to direct the upbringing of their children. That job is hard enough without schools catering to their child’s latest feelings about being a boy or a girl and keeping them in the dark about such potentially life-changing developments. The administration has locked arms with activists to pursue something likely to change a student’s life trajectory, whether parents like it or not. They are coming after schools in Georgia, too."},

Apart from her once being Catholic, there is little overlap in our personal biographies (though to her credit, she at least considered becoming a nun). Still, Emina Melonic opens her essay marking the 75th anniversary of The Second Sex with a Beauvoir quote even I can relate to: “I hesitated a long time before writing a book on woman. The subject is irritating, especially for women; and it is not new.” Women, and perhaps today especially conservative women, don’t want to be the token woman who writes about women. Though we do believe there are differences between the sexes, and that women’s perspectives are unique in certain ways, it feels like we are accepting the premise of identity politics. Sometimes we engage anyway, albeit reluctantly. I began writing about feminism because select conservatives (and so-called conservatives) were speaking about feminism, and women, in a ham-fisted and off-putting manner. And I suspect I am not alone in that reaction and concern. The larger feminist point is that women have intellectual interests that have nothing to do with us being women. Mary Wollstonecraft, for example, argued against a coquettish education for girls. Women are rational beings, who, like men, have varying talents. For all the extreme degradations of Beauvoir and the Sexual Revolution, this is a truth we can now take for granted, in part because of feminism, though only in part. Jane Austen captured the same disputation through Mrs. Croft, who states, “I hate to hear you talk about all women as if they were fine ladies instead of rational creatures. None of us want to be in calm waters all our lives.” >>> Men Without Meaning: The Harmful Effects of Expressive Individualism Melonic raises some pertinent questions in her essay. The first is to ask, tongue in cheek, if feminism is still talked about. There are quite a number of reasons it is, and I’d like to focus on a few: We have not settled on a satisfactory definition of feminism with widespread recognition (and are unlikely to do so). Relationships between men, women, and the family and questions surrounding work are impacted by economic churnings and technologies, which are continuously shifting. And we are parsing out to what extent feminism is responsible for our current cultural ills. Is Feminism Still Talked About? Indeed, feminism seems to be growing in popularity. A group of academics and journalists contribute to Fairer Disputations, which publishes original work and compiles essays that promote “a vision of female and male as embodied expressions of human personhood,” and affirm “that men and women are equal in their dignity and their capacity for human excellence, yet distinct in many significant ways, particularly when it comes to sex, pregnancy, childbirth, and care for children.” Feminism is a frequent topic on conservative outlets like The Daily Wire, and in recent years, scholars like UnHerd columnist Mary Harrington, Notre Dame professor Abigail Favale, journalist Louise Perry, and Ethics and Public Policy scholar Erika Bachiochi have published thought-provoking books on feminism and the Sexual Revolution. One reason for this could be that new technologies have created opportunities for conservative women, who sometimes take a break from their full-time jobs and careers to pursue the vocation of motherhood, to have more flexibility and maintain more engagement in the intellectual space. Their voices, as well as the perspective of women at other stages of life and in varying situations, could prove helpful (though not foolproof) in pulling feminism away from being ideological in the manner Melonic warns against: of one woman speaking for all and by turning “a legitimate grievance into collective victimhood.” They also could assist in moving feminism towards reflecting a “lived reality for women” (though working-class women still seem to be getting the short end of the stick). Overall, such a recalibration is likely good for conservatives, who haven’t always done so well with women. What is Feminism? Broadly, we are still talking about feminism because we lack a satisfactory definition. This is unlikely to be definitively settled, as feminism has always been a big tent with varying voices and coalitions, a feature that has its pros and cons. More to the point, the typical descriptions of the three waves of feminism, with second-wave feminism being equated with the Sexual Revolution, are often unnuanced and dissatisfying. When many criticize feminism, they are really talking about the Sexual Revolution, which is more cohesive yet not entirely monolithic. The Sexual Revolution was a rolling movement that sought to undermine sexual norms and relationships and often warred against nature and the family. Modern “feminism” is an outgrowth of the Sexual Revolution (Judith Butler, for example, is much more akin to revolutionary Kate Millett than Mary Wollstonecraft or Susan B. Anthony). Many recognize that the Sexual Revolution was disastrous for the family and undermined the truth that human beings belong to each other, and more people seem to be rejecting the false promises of the Sexual Revolution. The relationship between feminism and the Sexual Revolution is a messy one. Beauvoir herself demonstrates both the connections and tensions. She is widely considered a feminist (by what criteria is a good question), and her intellectual contribution of divorcing sex from gender is essential for the Sexual Revolution. But her views are not in complete accord, and are overall more extreme, than Betty Friedan, whose book The Feminine Mystique, sold over a million copies in its first year despite her being unknown, an event that marks the start of second-wave feminism. Friedan believed in differences between the sexes and the value of motherhood (though she sometimes also disparaged it), while Beauvoir contended that: Beauvoir was aiming to revolutionize society, while most women in the 1970s were in favor of improving the status of women. It seems fair to say that Friedan was more popular with everyday women, while Beauvoir rose in academia, evidencing that feminism speaks to multiple audiences. Feminism and Technology Parsing out the relationship between feminism and the Sexual Revolution is part of the renewed interest in feminism. So is understanding and addressing technological inventions and economic shifts that have changed how men, women, and families live, and even our comprehension of the human person. In “The Sexual Revolution Killed Feminism,” Mary Harrington has suggested that the relationship between men, women, the family, and material conditions should inform a better definition of feminism, that feminism is: Along with Harrington, Erika Bachiochi has emphasized that the Industrial Revolution took men away from family farms, precipitating an unprecedented division between labor and home. The rise of the knowledge economy and remote work present opportunities and challenges today. Remote work has the potential to reunite work and home. Women have done well, career-wise, in the global knowledge economy, while men without much education have been left behind in certain ways. If we are to renegotiate relationships between men, women, and the family, such phenomena are pertinent. In addition, innovations like the birth-control pill and synthetic hormones seemed to make the conquering of nature possible, contributing to the success of the Sexual Revolution. It’s hard to imagine people taking seriously the notion that gender is a social construct without such interventions. We are marching further down this path, with surgeries, reproductive technologies, and the looming possibilities of Artificial Intelligence. Social media, the smartphone, pornography, and online dating have changed the way men and women live and relate to one another, making it more difficult for them to form relationships or even have face-to-face interactions. As Melonic notes, “We are experiencing great shifts in society, especially in terms of human relationship to technology, which has rendered us more alienated from each other.” Is Feminism Responsible for Cultural Decline? Certainly, many of the conversations surrounding feminism are about identifying to what extent feminism is responsible for our current societal ills. Thinking through this is useful in considering which feminist or Sexual Revolutionist ideas or policies would need to be rolled back for positive change. Rather than feminism being the single poisonous tree, the rise of expressive individualism (or, as I believe is more precise, expressive autonomy) seems to encapsulate our current malaise better, positioning the Sexual Revolution as both a cause and symptom of character and cultural shifts. Expressive individualism is a combination of radical autonomy and the notion that the inner self is the true self, not necessarily reflective of or inextricably tied to the physical body. We live in a very self-focused subjective psychological world, with the rise of transgenderism, encouragements to achieve “self-actualization,” prioritize “me time” and “self-care,” and exhortations like “pursue your truth.” Relationships and morals are viewed as restrictive and burdensome, rather than ennobling and necessary for human flourishing. Public policy professor Andrew Cherlin demonstrates in The Marriage Go-Round that America’s churches, by shifting from a spirituality of dwelling to a spirituality of seeking, played a role in promoting expressive individualism. “The spirituality of seeking was not about laws or doctrines but about finding a style of spirituality that made you feel good, that seemed to fit your personality.” By around the 1950s, expressive individualism had captured the American mind. It had a tremendous impact on the stability of marriages, subverting the Christian view of marriage with an individualized romantic view based in emotional satisfaction. Religious denominations loosened laws pertaining to divorce simultaneously with, and even prior to, no-fault divorce, which led to further marital breakdown. In The Rise and Triumph of the Modern Self: Cultural Amnesia, Expressive Individualism, and the Road to the Sexual Revolution, theologian Carl Trueman traces the intellectual roots of expressive individualism, outing philosophers like Karl Marx, Jean Jacques Rousseau, and Beauvoir and psychologist Sigmund Freud. Likewise, Hillsdale College professor Kevin Slack identifies psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich as the “father of the modern sexual revolution in the US” and notes that Reich also influenced New Leftist Paul Goodman. This exercise raises some provocative questions: To what extent is the Sexual Revolution a project of feminism versus the arguments and political machinations of the New Left? Are certain religious denominations more susceptible to the degradation of expressive individualism and have they, in their warped form, even contributed to promoting its spread? Do we believe the lack of family formation and family separation today is mostly a rejection of marriage as a patriarchal capitalistic institution or because the purely romantic view of marriage, which brings with it almost unattainable standards for spouses and marriage, dominates? Perhaps there is simply more than one way to tell the story of familial and cultural breakdown. Yet first-wave feminist’s advocacy for women’s political equality seems unrelated to the development of expressive individualism. Further, these analyses demonstrate the magnitude and complexity of the problem we are facing. As Melonic notes, feminism feels like a peripheral issue when “we must first defend our humanity—our whole Selves—not just some aspects of who we are.” We don’t even agree on what it means to be human, that there is an objective and observable truth, or the primacy of reason. Finally, thinking through these questions helps us see the Sexual Revolution as both a contributor to and a manifestation of the shift from the human person to the psychological self. Beauvoir is crucial to the rise of expressive individualism, since she promoted a false anthropology that divorced sex from gender. >>> The Conservative Feminist Revolution But to turn back to Betty Friedan, we can see in 1963’s The Feminine Mystique, that the psychological self was already part of the social imagery. Friedan relied on the work of Abraham Maslow, who promoted the needs theory and the pursuit of “self-actualization.” In his view, according to Alma Acevedo, “ethical norms are neither consistent, universal, nor communicable, but precariously shut into the individual’s ‘private psychological world.’ Moral good is not what everyone ought to will, but what self-actualizers desire.” Friedan’s basing of her arguments on such false ideologies demonstrates that they indeed had an appeal, and in turn, her work contributed to their spread. What Now? Having discussions about feminism, defining it, and considering its relationship to the Sexual Revolution is academically compelling and useful in some ways. However, to find our way out on the ideas front, we will likely have to turn to sources that put forth a robust understanding of the human person, like the theology of the body, and natural law. The disagreements are fundamental and deep, beyond feminism. Practically, and probably more essentially, we need to move towards embodied interactions and promote role models. Men and women tend to learn how to be virtuous by imitating other good men and women; the breakdown of marriage and dad deprivation (and the ascendance of the online world) are significant sources of the confusion over what it means to be an admirable man, woman, and spouse. While examples in the real world are best, cultural portrayals of men, women, and marriage have significant effect. As Melonic argues, “literature, art, and film have revealed the complexities of being a woman better than any feminist or philosophical tract can even dream of doing.” In short, we need less Simone de Beauvoir—and more Jane Austen."},

", "Restoring patriarchy, and piety, is central to the conservative project. Without it, people will continue to suffer"], "text": "The following essay is excerpted from the forthcoming book Dawn’s Early Light: Burning Down Washington to Save America. “For the Lord sets a father in honor over his children.” —Sirach 3:2 “Smash the patriarchy.” That was the rallying cry of many progressives in the wake of Donald J. Trump’s 2016 election. They assumed this new president would drag the country back in time to Reagan’s America, or some unspecified sinister time. Women would suffer the consequences. They were wrong, of course, but not just about Trump. They were wrong about the nature of patriarchy and its relationship to the American way of life. This Father’s Day, I’m especially grateful for my PaPa Pete, a good Cajun man and an archetypal patriarch. But to understand how important he was in my life—and how important men like him are to our country today—you need to understand what Southern Louisiana was like in 1983. For most Americans, 1983 was the year the Reagan Revolution began to pay off. Inflation was in freefall while employment rates and wages were finally rising. America felt like it was roaring back and sloughing off the malaise and stupor of the 1970s. We were leaving Vietnam, stagflation, the Iran hostage crisis, lines at the gas station, and burnt-out cityscapes in the rear-view mirror. 1983 was a great year for America. >>> The Conservative Feminist Revolution It was a horrible year for my hometown of Lafayette, Louisiana. I was only nine, but I still remember how the same forces that brought America roaring back devastated Acadiana. Lafayette and its surrounds relied heavily on the energy economy, especially oil and natural gas coming off the Gulf of Mexico. Tens of thousands of Louisianans worked in all the different parts of the oil industry, from prospectors and drillers developing new fields, to roughnecks—like my PaPa Pete—working on offshore rigs in the Gulf, to the equipment operators and engineers at the refineries and petrochemical plants transforming crude into useful products. When the rest of the United States struggled to pay for gas in the ’70s, Southern Louisiana boomed, as investment capital and new jobs rushed in to boost America’s domestic energy production. Now, with oil prices plummeting, it was our turn to be walloped. Plants closed, energy companies laid off workers by the hundreds, and a deep economic contraction set in. Soon, men whose families lived in the region for centuries packed up to look for work elsewhere. In the wake of this economic downturn came social collapse. With our local economy, Catholic diocesan schools, and way of life crumbling, the worst parts of Cajun culture came to the fore. The insularity, the family dramas, the indifference to education, the neglect, the divorce, the drinking. It all got worse, and my family was no exception. My parents divorced. My dad, who was suffering from alcoholism, could no longer provide for our family. My mom took a full-time job at Sears Roebuck. We moved into subsidized housing and started receiving free lunch at school. In the middle of that vortex of chaos stood a patriarch: my grandfather, Mark “Pete” Pete. A man of deep devotion to God, country, and family, PaPa Pete was born in Opelousas, St. Landry Parish, Louisiana, in 1919. He grew up dirt poor, dropping out of school to work at a local mechanic’s shop, but after Pearl Harbor, he answered his country’s call, volunteering to serve as a United States Marine in World War II. With his outstanding mechanical ability, he was trained as an airplane mechanic and assigned to a base in Southern California, where he met my grandmother Betty French in the engine well of an airplane they were working on. Not even five feet tall, she had found her niche installing radars and other systems in the nose of aircraft. She could easily maneuver where the burly Marine mechanics would be flummoxed. Their romance blossomed, and they married days after Victory in Europe Day in May 1945. My mom was born the next year. Upon their discharge from the Marines, PaPa Pete persuaded my grandmother to move the family back home to Opelousas. He worked as a roughneck at Esso, later Exxon Mobil. He’d hitchhike to the coast for a boat ride out to the rig, working seven days on, seven off. It was some of the physically toughest work there is, but he took pride in his job and in supporting his family. PaPa Pete was a man’s man. He had strong, gnarled hands, and was a genius at fixing anything mechanical. He was not stoic, but not especially expressive either. He liked to work hard and to enjoy the company of friends, a cold beer, and a baseball game. We wiled away afternoons together watching the Atlanta Braves on TV. And he took full advantage of living in “the Sportsmen’s Paradise,” fishing with the best of them. But he was also gentle and faithful. He was an old-fashioned gentleman who believed in taking care of women, my own grandmother first of all. And I remember many a time working in the yard with him on a Saturday afternoon and being ordered to wash up: We were going to Confession. The family never had much, but my grandfather always had an envelope for the offering plate at Mass, which the whole family went to every Sunday. Like many Cajun men, PaPa Pete also had a special devotion to the Virgin Mary. He always had his rosary at his bedside. And he remained devoted to his own widowed mother (my great-grandmother), visiting her almost every day of her long life. For me, PaPa Pete was a role model, a man in my life I could count on. He gave me stability, normalcy, and constant love. As my community fell apart, I clung to him, the way you might lash yourself to a bald cypress in a hurricane. Back then, I didn’t appreciate how deep his roots went, how much I owed the stability I desperately needed to a tradition and a faith that stretched back centuries. PaPa Pete gave me that. Another word for what PaPa Pete’s patriarchy gave me is “piety.” The left likes to describe patriarchy as a system of male power that is obsessed with controlling women, like in The Handmaid’s Tale or Barbie. But outside their ivory towers, patriarchy looks a lot more like Little House on the Prairie and It’s a Wonderful Life. In small towns like Lafayette, patriarchy simply means patrimony. It looks like fathers and grandfathers passing down family traditions to their sons and grandsons, teaching them to take pride in where they come from, to steward their family name, and to pass on that tradition to the next generation. Central to patriarchy is piety. Piety is a weight. It is a sense of responsibility. It is knowing what we owe to others on account of what we have been given. It is gratitude for what we inherited. It is “the wise man” who “knows himself as debtor” and is “inspired by a deep sense of obligation,” in the words of Bertrand de Jouvenel. It is what the Romans called pietas and considered chief of the virtues—the most essential to their republic. Piety is the principal fruit of patriarchy, and it is the heart of conservatism. Conservatives acknowledge that our lives depend on what we have been given: by God, by our country, by our forebears, by our communities and families. In gratitude, our hearts move us to defend, improve, and pass on what we inherited. We experience gratitude to our parents as a glad calling of duty to our posterity. As Renaissance scholar and classicist James Hankins explains: In a normal and healthy society, formative institutions help open the eyes of their charges to the magnitude of what they inherited. Indeed, that’s what patriarchy—and Father’s Day—is really all about. Today, though, even conservatives have abandoned patriarchy, and the piety that it engenders. This Father’s Day, for example, an abundance of conservative think-pieces bemoan the lack of fathers in homes and point out the social-science showing that children who grow up without dads have worse outcomes. And rightfully so: Nearly one in four (18 million) American children grow up without a biological, step-, or adoptive father at home, making them much more likely to live in poverty, go to prison, abuse drugs and alcohol, and drop out of school. >>> A Truly Pro-Family Culture But few pieces, however, point out that the number of absentee fathers is a direct byproduct of the degradation of patriarchy—the natural form of familial relations—in our culture. Indeed, conservatives and progressives alike point to men’s failures to serve, but they ignore the fact that men are no longer incentivized to lead and take responsibility for their extended families. To be clear, individual men are ultimately responsible for their own decisions. But in a culture that denigrates patriarchy, we shouldn’t be surprised that more men don’t stick around. Without my PaPa Pete’s example, I’m not sure I would have. If conservatives continue trying to treat symptoms without getting to root causes, the problem will only get worse over time. That’s why restoring patriarchy, and piety, is central to the conservative project. Without it, people will continue to suffer—as so many in my community did in the 1980s—and our political movement will continue to falter over time. The left understands this. Their motto was “smash the patriarchy,” after all, not “crush conservatism” or “shatter supply-side economics.” It is time conservatives do the same and make restoring patriarchy a central pillar of their agenda. What made the difference in my life was faith, hope, and love: the faith of my fathers, hope in God’s plan for my life, and the love of my family and my community. The difference between my life and that of so many lost and broken men in Southern Louisiana was my PaPa Pete. His patriarchal example gave me a deep sense of who I was, of my story, and my culture. He taught me that there was a place where I belonged and a people I belonged to. He taught me to be deeply grateful for the past, but also to be hopeful about the future. He taught me that our traditions are alive and that our best days are ahead of us. This Father’s Day, looking at my own son, I’m proud to say that PaPa Pete was right."},

", "Women should not be sacrificed on the altar of gender ideology just because they’re behind bars."], "text": "Prison rape is horrific in any case, but gender ideologues in Washington have found a way to make it more common—all in the name of fairness to men who “identify as women.” The list of accusers grows by the day. Rose Doe—a former female inmate in Rikers Island women’s prison in New York—was groped and raped by a male prisoner in 2022. In her lawsuit against the New York Department of Corrections, she alleged that the perpetrator told his cellmate that he claimed to be “trans” just so he could gain access to women. The number of sex crimes leading to his incarceration ought to have been enough proof of what was likely to come. Ms. Doe’s story is not unique. In 2020, Tomieika Johnson, who had been in an abusive marriage before her incarceration, was forced to live with a male serial rapist, Richard Masbruch, at the Central California Women’s Facility. When she pointed to increasing incidents in the prison against inmates, including rape, she was told to “give it a chance.” She believes that, in doing so, “California has re-abused me, re-traumatized me.” More than 20 years ago, President George W. Bush signed the Prison Rape Elimination Act, or PREA, into law. Its goal was to eradicate prisoner rape. Just this week, a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by Corey Booker, New Jersey Democrat, held a hearing to assess the state of sexual assault since the law passed. But the hearing seems to have largely avoided this elephant in the room: the precipitous rise in the sexual assault of women prisoners forced to share confined spaces with men identifying as women—including men imprisoned for committing sexual assault. The fights to preserve in law the natural distinctions between men and women have raged coast to coast for the better part of a decade. Happily, in some cases, states have passed favorable laws protecting women’s athletics or restricting the use of irreversible drugs and surgeries for minors suffering gender distress. But the women in local, state and federal custody are the most voiceless and invisible in our public debates. As a result, they remain largely and unusually vulnerable. The men who seek entry into women’s prisons aren’t a random sample. Of the 161 biological men housed in the Wisconsin Department of Corrections who identify as transgender, 50.3% of them have been convicted of at least one count of sexual assault or sexual abuse. As of September, there are 2,186 incarcerated people who identify as transgender, nonbinary or intersex in California. One-third of the biological males in this group who seek to transfer to female prisons are convicted sex offenders. None of this ought to be surprising. There are innate biological differences between men and women. We know that on average, men are larger, stronger and more violent than women. We know that men commit almost all rapes. That’s why we have separate jails and prisons for men and women in the first place. Such separation is more, not less, important when it comes to males incarcerated for violent sexual offenses. And yet in the name of fairness, political elites on Capitol Hill have tinkered with the PREA to ensure that male inmates who identify as women are treated as women. A clown-world measure of fairness trumps the safety and privacy of female inmates. This manipulation of a 20-year-old civil rights law does violence to the intentions of its drafters and to the very women it was designed to protect. When it comes to incarceration, inmates have no choice over where they are housed, where quarters are cramped, where privacy is diminished. As a result, Congress would do well to revisit the Prison Rape Elimination Act. Rather than simply giving lip service to prison safety, it’s time to earnestly ensure prisons are once again governed by law, order and common sense. Women should not be sacrificed on the altar of gender ideology just because they’re behind bars."},

But during the 2021-22 school year, acting on nothing more than a seventh-grade girl’s email to a school counselor and without notifying her parents, East Rockford Middle School personnel began treating her as a boy and allowing her access to all boys-only school facilities. They actively concealed the situation from the girl’s parents, and even altered school records that the parents might see. Such policies are not only problematic on their own terms but a violation of the parents’ right to direct the upbringing and education of their own children. East Rockford is no exception, unfortunately. The database maintained by the organization Parents Defending Education currently lists 1,059 school districts in 38 states, including more than 18,000 schools attended by nearly 11 million students, with such policies. >>> Shining a Light on School District Actions Many policies use “sex” and “gender” interchangeably for the biological fact that an individual is male or female. For example, the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, policy explains that “gender identity” is a person’s “sense or psychological knowledge of their own gender….Individuals determine their own gender identity and gender identity may change over time.” And “transgender” is used to refer to “people whose gender identity is different” from their biological sex. The centerpiece of these policies is a student’s gender-related communication, which these policies typically refer to in concrete terms as an “assertion” of “gender identity.” School personnel are required to take that communication at face value, treat it as conclusive, and immediately begin treating the student in accord with that communication. The Ann Arbor, Michigan, policy is typical: “The school shall accept the gender identity that each student asserts.” Dictionaries define an assertion as a “a confident and forceful statement of fact or belief,” “a statement that you strongly believe is true,” or “a declaration that’s made emphatically.” Gender identity is a subjective self-perception, entirely unique to the individual. By definition, then, a student’s perception, let alone an attempt to communicate anything about it, defies any one-size-fits-all formula. And remember, “gender identity may change over time.” This can place school personnel in something of a bind. Under the Escondido, California, policy, for example, a student’s “assertion of their gender identity,” by itself, means that school personnel must “begin to treat the student immediately, consistently with that gender identity.” Not only may a student’s communication fall far short of a bold or emphatic statement, but school personnel may have no basis for recognizing, interpreting, or understanding what a student’s communication may actually be. Their only option is to treat any gender-related communication as an “assertion” of gender identity—whether it is or not. Questions or reactions are the same as bold declarations. It makes no difference whether a student’s perception is vague or clear, fleeting or persistent, recent or longstanding. These policies require taking whatever the student may try to communicate as conclusive and to treat that student accordingly. >>> Trans Athlete Injures Multiple Girls, Forcing Team To Forfeit. Wither Thou, Feminism? Beyond such problems, these policies violate the right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children, which has been recognized in the common law, statutes, and under the U.S. Constitution for centuries. These policies, which typically apply to students of any age, prohibit disclosure of any “gender information” to anyone outside the school without the student’s consent. The Escondido policy even lists parents among those who have no legitimate need to know such information. No one, however, knows more than parents about a child’s life, medical history and needs, personality, relationships, and other factors that relate to his or her wellbeing. Excluding parental input or knowledge, therefore, leaves schools free to impose upon students their own theory or ideology regarding gender-related matters. Research shows that, in more than 90 percent of cases, early expressions of gender confusion resolve themselves once minors go through puberty. That is, without interference from school policies like these. Even more frightening is research indicating that social transitioning—referring to individuals by different names and pronouns, granting access to single-sex facilities of their choice, and the like—can lead to medical transitioning. The use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, and surgery to change an individual’s appearance, is permanent. All of this can flow from a minor’s random question or observation while parents, if they gain any knowledge about it at all, left to watch this trainwreck for their family."},

That, regrettably, is not a hypothetical question. That’s exactly what happened to real young women earlier this year in preliminary pageants in two European nations, Portugal and the Netherlands. On Saturday night, those countries will be represented by a pair of transgender faux females at the 72nd annual Miss Universe pageant. To borrow a vintage 55-year-old advertising line from Virginia Slims cigarettes, “You’ve come a long way, Baby.” Just not in the way Phillip Morris envisioned it in 1968.\n \nAnd there may be yet more humiliation and heartbreak ahead for the XX-chromosomed real women participating in the pageant this weekend. Don’t discount the possibility that either “Miss” Portugal, Marina Machete, or “Miss” Netherlands, Rikkie Valerie Kolle, could walk away with the sash and tiara this weekend in El Salvador. >>> Even the Census Bureau Is Trying To Promote Radical Gender Ideology That’s because the CEO of the company that now owns and operates the Miss Universe pageant, JKN Global Group, is Anne Jakapong Jakrajutatip, a Thai man who himself insists he’s a woman, biology to the contrary notwithstanding.\n \nHis modus operandi for the pageant appears to be “if it ain’t broke, break it.” “Trans women are women, full stop,” the Miss Universe Organization declared after Machete won the Portuguese crown. (“Full stop”? Really? At the risk of a double entendre here, they … umm … forgot the “period.” Or maybe the omission was intentional.) Last November, shortly after acquiring the pageant, Jakrajutatip vowed to the Bangkok Post newspaper: “We will adopt a new concept, ‘One universe,’ in which opportunities to participate in the competition will be given also to trans women and married women, and fairness in the contest judging will be ensured.” (emphasis added) And we all know how the unhinged Left spells “fairness”: D-E-I, as in “diversity, equity and inclusion.” “This will be the first beauty contest with real gender equality and inclusion,” Jakrajutatip averred. Not quite. “Miss” Portugal and “Miss” Netherlands aren’t the first transgender “women” to compete for the Miss Universe crown. In 2018, Angela Ponce, “Miss Spain,” beat them to it, but finished out of the Top 10 finalists. The Portuguese and Dutch contestants will be competing against 90 real women from around the world, including, for the first time, a contestant from Pakistan. Ten other countries have withdrawn from this year’s pageant, though it’s unknown whether any of them did so to protest the participation of the faux females. Italy did the next best thing: It barred transgender “women” from its Miss Universe competition, stipulating that its contestants “must be a woman from birth.” (Miss Italy is not affiliated with the Miss Universe Organization, however, and the Miss Italy Universe pageant is a separate contest, according to CNN.) >>> Liberal Hypocrites Are Destroying Women’s Sports Even if the Miss Universe pageant weren’t owned by a transgender person, it wouldn’t be entirely surprising that biological men have been allowed into the competition, given that so many other endeavors heretofore reserved exclusively for real women have been invaded by these intersex interlopers, most notably high school and collegiate athletics. So has the annual Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, and earlier this month, Glamour magazine named as one of its seven “women of the year” a transgender model, whom one critic ridiculed on Glamour’s Instagram page as “a man in a dress.” What’s just as disconcerting is the deafening silence of liberal “cisgender” women who purport to champion women’s rights but who won’t stand up for the real girls and women being cheated out of athletic awards and scholarships—or, in this case, pageant titles. As recently as 2015, the Miss Universe pageant was co-owned by Donald Trump, who, for the past couple of years, has spoken out forcefully against allowing faux females to interlope in girls’ and women’s sports. Maybe the once-and-(perhaps)-future president should buy the pageant back and make the Miss Universe pageant great again. Or at least make it all-XX chromosomes again."},

It is part of a new set of questions on sexual orientation and gender identity that the bureau wants to ask residents even as young as 15. This expansion beyond race and ethnicity represents a new foray into sexual identity—one more step in the bureau’s decadeslong degeneration into an agency completely captured by the identity-mongering industry, and which produces the supposedly “victim” categories that the industry requires. The self-feeding loop works like this: the bureau creates categories out of whole cloth, hiving off segments of our population that had been until now not collectivized, such as Hispanics or Asian Americans, which it did in 1980, and then produces “data” on this new segment, both officializing them and creating the apparent need for government action to protect them. Indeed, the bureau informed Congress that the question or questions would be contained in the American Community Survey, which “generates data that help determine how more than $675 billion in Federal and state funds are distributed each year.” >>> School Policies Hiding Students’ Gender Identities Face Different Legal Fates The survey goes out to around 300,000 residents every year and is the “premier source of social, demographic, economic, and housing information for the nation, states, counties, cities, and towns,” according to the agency. The testing that the bureau asks that Congress appropriate $10 million to pay for would be all about creating buy-in among the public about the existence of the birth-assignment myth—“this initiative supports cognitive testing to better construct question wording on SOGI topics,” says the Census Bureau—but also about their marginalized status. There is an “emerging need of our Nation to improve the measurement of sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) population,” the bureau claims. “Improving how we collect data about sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations is a critical step in producing accurate data.” This is hogwash. There is an emerging need to validate sexual orientation and gender identities only for those interested in fanning this particular social contagion. But the Census Bureau doesn’t want to stop there. It apparently wants to additionally transform the questions on race. Its request said there would be a “potential for new questions relating to sexual orientation, gender identity, and intersexuality and/or potential modifications to the race and ethnicity questions.” The bureau is clearly going back for a second bite at the apple. It tried in 2017 to create a quasi-racial category for Hispanics—who are now only an ethnicity, as Hispanics, indeed, come in many races—and add one for Americans with ancestries in the Middle East and North Africa. A handful of us alerted the Trump administration back then, and these “innovations” never came about. This year’s idea comes wrapped in the fiscal 2023 budget request to Congress and has already been slammed by two senators. Sens. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and J.D. Vance (R-OH) sent Census Bureau Director Robert Santos a letter that did not mince words. “Biology determines gender, not subjective belief, and the bureau should not jeopardize the legitimacy of crucial statistical information by endorsing unscientific and untrue concepts like gender identity,” the two senators wrote. “It’s important to recognize that the notion of ‘gender identity’ is unscientific, subjective, and political. Those who promote the concept themselves admit that gender identity is fluid and may be changed by an individual on a whim. … How an individual chooses to express themselves is a matter of personality, not ‘gender identity.’\" “Questioning minors about their ‘gender identity,’” they added, “risks misleading them that the concept is valid and backed by the U.S. government—which it emphatically is not.” The senators sensibly note that we could gather data on the aforementioned social contagion of gender theory. There might be a need to get data “about the dramatic and troubling rise in gender dysphoria,” they write. But there are ways to get information on the epidemic without validating the concepts. The Left is constantly wrapping itself on the mantle of being the party of science, but nothing gives the lie to such a claim more than gender theory. >>> Census Errors Will Distort Elections, Funding for Next Decade Even the National Institutes of Health, never one to look askance at wokeness, prizes science over wokeness on this matter, and the Cleveland Clinic agrees: sex is determined soon after the sperm fertilizes the egg. “Out of the 46 chromosomes that make up a baby's genetic material, only 2—1 from the sperm and 1 from the egg—determine the baby's sex,” says the NIH. Bonus point: notice that the NIH calls the zygote, the fertilized egg, a “baby.” It is unclear if the bureau uses “gender” as a synonym for biological sex or as the natural expectations that normal men and women without an agenda attach to biological sex, since the Left uses both meanings interchangeably. But even if it were only the latter, how individuals choose to meet those expectations is simply a matter of personality, as the senators say, not an identity out of which to carve out an official identity with rights, set-asides, etc. The only quibble with the senators’ letter is where it says that, if it were to proceed, the Census Bureau would “damage its credibility as an authoritative statistical body. … For generations, the American people have looked to the U.S. Census as an unbiased, authoritative source describing the objective reality of life in America.” For those who follow these issues, that hasn’t been the case for several decades. A new administration will have to clean house in the bureau at least as much as in other agencies. A good starting point is to rid the surveys of faux racial and ethnic categories and not add new ones, especially those that include sex. Instead, let’s ask things with a direct impact on success and failure, such as family formation."},

In a new regulation released last week, the Biden administration changed the definition of “sex” in a crucial civil rights law that was originally designed to protect women. Title IX of the Civil Rights Act says that schools cannot discriminate against individuals based on sex, which gave women better access to higher education and athletics. But the administration has swapped “sex” for “gender,” which will allow biological males access to females’ bathrooms, locker rooms, sports competitions, etc. K-12 educators around the country are wondering what to do next because this rule would have major implications for school facilities and athletic teams. Washington wants schools to change their harassment policies, too, because the new rule says individuals could face charges of harassment if they address someone according to his or her sex instead of “gender” choice. Our advice to educators: Wait. >>> School Gender Policies Harm Students and Violate Parents’ Right To Raise Their Children The administration’s rule violates numerous administrative laws and constitutional free-speech provisions, not to mention women’s civil rights. The rule goes into effect Aug. 1, and we forecast a long, hot summer of litigation that will stall and should ultimately overturn this rule. The rule violates state laws that protect women’s athletics and prohibit men from competing in women’s sports. Louisiana Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley has already issued a letter to school officials in his state saying the rule violates their state’s Fairness in Women’s Sports Act, which keeps single-sex sports just that—for individuals of one sex to compete with each other: girls’ soccer for girls, boys’ basketball for boys, as schools have operated for generations. “This rule runs contradictory to the entire foundation of Title IX,” Mr. Brumley wrote to teachers and principals. “The Title IX rule changes recklessly endanger students and seek to dismantle equal opportunities for females.” The lead education officials of Oklahoma and South Carolina have sent similar letters to educators in their states. The rule also ignores research that finds health professionals do not know enough about the long-term effects of drugs and medicines being used to alter human bodies, including the biological functions of children. Earlier this month, England’s National Health Service released a report that the Times U.K. called “the world’s biggest review into the contested field of transgender healthcare.” The release, called the Cass Report, found that scientists “have no good evidence” on the long-term outcomes from puberty blockers, hormone treatments and surgeries that alter reproductive organs. Young people in particular may feel “an urgency to transition,” the Cass Report said, but “young adults looking back at their younger selves would often advise slowing down.” The report’s authors said the effects of so-called gender interventions “needs to be better understood.” >>> Women’s Sports on the Chopping Block The Independent Women’s Forum, an advocacy organization, has already announced its intent to sue the administration. The new rule “turns Title IX on its head through extra-statutory regulations,” the group said in a press release. Public opinion sides with Mr. Brumley, the Cass Report, and the Independent Women’s Forum. A 2023 survey of Americans found that 55% of respondents said it is “morally wrong” to change your gender, an increase of 4 percentage points from 2021. In the same survey, 69% of Americans said that “transgender athletes should only be allowed to compete on sports teams that conform with their birth gender.” Americans do not like watching videos on social media of middle school girls getting thrown down by a boy in a basketball game or of a high school girl having her teeth knocked out while playing field hockey. Nor do any parents want their daughters to share a locker room with a boy. The Biden administration is violating civil rights law and ignoring research and public opinion. School officials would do well to wait before changing school rules—both to see what happens in court and to protect students and teachers from this harmful policy."},

Not satisfied with stealing the NCAA Division I, 500-meter freestyle championship from a woman in 2022, Thomas is now suing World Aquatics in the international Court of Arbitration for Sport for its refusal to let Thomas, who was born male but identifies as transgender, compete in the women’s category in elite swimming events such as the USA Olympic Team Swimming Trials. Their onerous regulation? World Aquatics permits transgender women to compete in women’s events only if they transitioned before age 12 or before one of the early stages of puberty. >>> HB 47: The Fairness in Girls’ Sports Act Ms. Shaw believes that the deep divisions over transgender athletic participation are based not on research evidence on trans athletic advantages, but rather on “our deeply-held and rather largely unexamined assumptions about biology and gender.” But those purported assumptions are backed by hard scientific research referenced in the joint statement of the International Federation of Sports Medicine and the European Federation of Sports Medicine Associations, which indicated that the International Olympic Committee—with its trans-inclusive sport regulations—had failed to take proper account of “scientific, biological or medical aspects.” In particular, it ignored that “high testosterone concentrations, either endogenous or exogenous, confer a baseline advantage for athletes in certain sports … and must be mitigated.” World Aquatics later convened its own group of scientists with the aim of developing sport-specific transgender athletic regulations. In findings to file under “told you so,” the scientists reported that “biological sex is a key determinant of athletic performance,” with males outperforming females in sports (including aquatic sports) that are primarily determined by neuromuscular, cardiovascular and respiratory function, and anthropometrics including body and limb size. The Independent Women’s Forum compiled some of the more compelling research on physiological distinctions between men and women in its report “Competition,” available at the group’s website. So yes, Lia Thomas—at 6 feet, 1 inches tall, with broader shoulders, higher muscle mass, greater bone density and longer legs—has a distinct athletic benefit over even the most highly trained female aquatic competitors in the world. Like other feminists, Ms. Shaw stresses the “illusion of difference” between the sexes, claiming that if “women cut their hair the same way as men, wore ‘men’s’ clothes, and didn’t shave their legs and underarms, wear makeup, or pluck their eyebrows, they wouldn’t look nearly as different from men as they do.” But there is a yawning chasm of difference between looking the same and being the same. And for decades, feminists fought the tired trope that women are to be distinguished (from men and each other) primarily by how they look. This a strangely reductionist argument for a purported feminist to rely so much on superficial expressions of womanhood. Womanhood is not makeup, hairstyles, dresses or high heels. And even critically thinking gender zealots ought to know better. >>> Women’s Sports on the Chopping Block A favorite tactic of the anti-biology crowd is to force a convolution of the sexes and paint immutable differences as artificial, ensuring that women’s equality can be decimated sport by sport, bathroom by bathroom, program by program. Ms. Shaw strains to argue that we “can’t even define biological sex all that well.” Of course we can. Sex is defined by sexual reproduction and sex cells called gametes. Biologists recognize it. Other professors recognize it. Teenagers recognize it. Federal judges recognize it (though perhaps not all Supreme Court justices do). Even young children, observant as they are, recognize that boys and girls are different. Why else would there be a need to proselytize these same children into a world where gender unicorns, drag queens and subjective self-identification take the place of what their eyes know to be true? The motivating force behind significant civil rights gains for women was the understanding that while men and women are different, opportunities for each must be equal. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote as much in 1996 in her majority opinion in U.S. v. Virginia: “Physical differences between men and women, however, are enduring: ‘[T]he two sexes are not fungible; a community made up exclusively of one [sex] is different from a community composed of both.’” In the battle for women’s athletic equality, male bodies will always be the problem."},

DeSantis, who passed multiple bills in Florida protecting children from gender ideology, hammered Haley and Christie on their seemingly hands-off legal approach. In her appearance on CBS Mornings this week, Haley declined to take a stance on the federal role in protecting minors from medicalized gender treatments, instead deferring to parents. “What care should be on the table?” asked the host, “What should the law allow?” In response, Haley argued that “the law should stay out of it, and parents should handle it… And then when that child becomes 18, if they want to make more of a permanent change, they can do that.” It’s unclear if Haley is in favor of cross-sex hormones, puberty blockers—interventions that can cause irreversible damage to a developing body—with a parent’s approval. Despite her soft answer on this issue, elsewhere Nikki Haley has indicated that she favors a federal ban on so-called sex change surgeries for minors. She also opposes taxpayer funding for transition surgeries. >>> States May Protect Minors by Banning “Gender-Affirming Care” Given her pro-woman platform, she signed the Concerned Women for America’s pledge to enforce sex-binary distinctions. Haley firmly committed to protect women in law and in women’s shelters, sports, prisons, and education. Her answer on women’s sports is particularly strong, calling the infiltration of male athletes “the women’s issue of our time.” Still, DeSantis did not wait long in last night’s debate before criticizing her statement that the “law should stay out of it.” In response to Haley’s initial rebuttal, DeSantis said, She didn’t respond to the criticism; it wasn’t about the Parents Rights in Education bill. It was about prohibiting sex change operations on minors, they do puberty blockers, these are irreversible. Talk to Chloe Cole—she went through this, now [that] she’s an adult, she’s warning against it. She may never be able to have kids again. That is what Nikki Haley opposed. DeSantis continued saying, She said the law shouldn’t get involved in that, and I just asked you if you’re somebody that’s going to be the President of the United States, and you can’t stand up against child abuse, how are you going to be able to stand up for anything?” Haley’s response illustrates the primary difference between her approach and DeSantis’s. “I never said that,” Haley responded. “I never said that. I said that if you have to be 18 to get a tattoo, you should have to be 18 to have anything done to change your gender.” To some degree, it appears that DeSantis and others on social media may be misrepresenting Haley. Still, her “leave it to the parents” approach misses the point that doctors and a financially motivated pharmaceutical industry are among the biggest offenders in the fight against gender ideology. Many detransitioners share that their parents—who in many cases are scared, working with limited medical resources, or whose second language is English—are told by doctors that social transition and medical interventions are the only way to protect their child. In many cases, as with Chloe Cole, the children are struggling with autism, poor mental health, sexual assault, or discomfort during puberty. >>> Even the Census Bureau Is Trying To Promote Radical Gender Ideology By saying the law should stay out of it, Nikki Haley is effectively giving doctors free reign to take advantage of vulnerable parents and children. Many doctors encourage cross-sex hormones, gender mutilating surgeries, or puberty blockers under the false claim that the latter is safe and reversible. There is a big difference between a limited government and a weak government. Nikki Haley’s preference for the law to “stay out of it” puts the very parents and children she aims to protect at greater risk. We need the states and the federal government to protect the rights of both parents and children. Unless we have both, parents could lose custody of their children if they do not affirm their child’s stated “gender identity.” This is already happening in states like California. The uncomfortable truth, too, is that some parents encourage their children to transition. As DeSantis argued in response to Chris Christie last night, “as a parent, you do not have the right to abuse your kids.” Parents have the right to use their God-ordained freedom for the best interests of their child; something parents are best equipped to understand and do. Still, the Bible places limits on such authority if they command someone to sin (Ephesians 6:1). The law should, too. The fight against gender ideology requires strong and courageous leaders who do not hesitate to use the legal power of the purse and the sword to hold bad actors accountable for their actions."},

Mostly thanks to outraged parents, the resistance against gender ideology scored its first major victories in 2023. States passed dozens of laws prohibiting secret “gender-support plans,” protecting women’s sports or restricting gender drugs and surgery on kids. There are, as yet, no such victories for another class of victims who lack a natural political constituency to protect them: female prisoners. There have been thousands of stories in the last two years of schools that “socially transition” kids behind their parents’ backs, males joining female sports teams and teens harmed by “gender-affirming” drugs and surgeries. Thank God this disturbing trend is being spotlighted. But the media should pay more attention to the plight of women behind bars. >>> The Fight Against Gender Ideology Needs Strong Parents, Leaders, and Laws The latest such victim is revealed in a lawsuit just filed against the New York Department of Correction. The anonymous plaintiff Rose Doe—a former female prisoner in Rikers’ Rose M. Singer women’s jail—says she was groped and raped by a male prisoner in 2022. The suit alleges the perpetrator told a prison mate he claimed to be “trans” just so he could gain access to women. And, as is common in these cases, the perpetrator had allegedly racked up enough offenses to provide fair warning of what was to come. A correction officer even allegedly coached the defendant on how to get transferred. Two female guards are also named as defendants, for ignoring complaints about the male prisoner in question. No doubt, given these details, some will propose a Solomonic solution: Authorities should ensure only “true trans” men enjoy the company of women prisoners and weed out the cynical, sex-starved fakers. Such a policy may seem clever, but it’s bound to fail. According to gender ideology, a person might be born in the wrong body and so be “assigned male at birth” but “identify as” a female. Hence, the only criterion for determining a person’s “gender identity,” per orthodoxy, is to ask. There’s no blood test, brain scan or infallible battery of questions that could allow a prison doctor to separate the trans wheat from the cheater chaff. If a man says he identifies as a woman, that’s enough. No extra verification is needed. I don’t want to belabor this argument, however, lest we miss a crucial point. For far too long, we have allowed ourselves to be gaslighted into conceding what we all know. Out of misplaced compassion and confusion, we avoid affirming the real, observable, biological differences between males and females. Instead, we talk about “gender diversity” and “natal males” and “gender identities” and “sex assigned at birth.” We should have compassion for anyone so distressed that he or she wants a whole new body. But justice requires us to drop the gassy euphemisms and state the obvious: Just because a man—whether sincerely or cynically—“identifies” as a woman doesn’t magically make him one. As New Jersey learned the hard way, a man who identifies as a woman can even impregnate two fellow female inmates. Subjective states of mind don’t trump biology. Every civilized society separates female and male prisoners. >>> States May Protect Minors by Banning “Gender-Affirming Care” Why? It’s not because of a supposed “internal sense of gender” but because of innate biological differences between them. We know that men are, on average, larger, stronger and more violent than women. We know that men commit almost all rapes. Because of these differences, common sense dictates boys and girls should have separate bathrooms. We know this when it comes to Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Technical High School and Dalton—whatever their misguided policies may be and even though most male high schoolers aren’t rapists. So how can we ignore biological differences when it comes to prisons, where the men in question are criminals? Unwittingly, many who support putting men who identify as women in female prisons concede this point. They argue that such men are at much greater risk for rape and violence if they remain in male prisons. That’s no doubt true. And it’s precisely why—however we accommodate such men—we should not subject women prisoners to the same risk."},

Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), the ERA’s lead House sponsor for two decades, flatly insisted that it “has absolutely nothing to do with abortion.” Some might have been tempted to quote Queen Gertrude from Shakespeare’s Hamlet that “the lady doth protest too much, methinks.” In a recent decision, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has shown why no one believed her anyway. Congress proposed the ERA, first introduced in 1923, in March 1972. It read: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States of by any State on account of sex.” Fewer than the necessary three-fourths of the states, however, ratified it by the deadline Congress imposed. The 1972 ERA failed for two reasons. First, the ERA’s twin objectives had already been met without it. States and the federal government had been eliminating discriminatory laws since the 1930s. And the Supreme Court had interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment’s requirement of equal protection to apply to sex discrimination. >>> The ERA Has Just One Purpose Left: Abortion Second, even after decades and dozens of hearings, no consensus existed, even among supporters, about what the ERA’s indeterminate language meant or how it would apply. Untethered to its original purpose, the ERA was thus ripe for use to achieve other political goals such as abortion rights. Abortion activists had for years made clear their intention to use the ERA to that end. The 1977 National Women’s Conference Action Plan, for example, called for both ratification of the ERA and protection of “reproductive freedom.” At its January 1979 meeting, President Jimmy Carter’s National Advisory Committee for Women explicitly connected the ERA to its pro-abortion agenda. A year later, the same committee explained that examining the application of similar ERAs in state constitutions would be an “easy way” to understand the federal ERA’s impact. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s recent decision in Allegheny Reproductive Health Center v. Pennsylvania Dept. of Human Services is Exhibit A. In this case, abortion clinics challenged a state law prohibiting spending public funds for the performance of abortion except to save the mother’s life or when the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. They argued that three provisions guarantee the general equal protection of the laws and the state ERA specifically prohibits discrimination “because of the sex of the individual.” One of the court’s seven members did not participate and the court voted 4-2 to overrule its unanimous 1985 decision in Fischer v. Dept. of Public Welfare, which held in a similar challenge that the funding exclusion did not violate these same constitutional provisions. The majority paid lip service to the principle that the basis for interpreting a constitutional provision must be its “plain language” and that there must be a “special justification” to overrule a precedent “over and above the belief that [it] was wrongly decided.” The majority, however, did not actually use these principles to reach its conclusion. The heart of Fischer was that the requirement for state funding of abortion when it funded the exercise of other constitutional rights was “found no where in our state Constitution.” That conclusion focused squarely where it should, on the constitutional text. >>> Federal Appeals Court Foils Another Biden Abortion Scheme The basic equal protection principle is that the law should treat similarly situated people similarly. Men and women are obviously not similarly situated with respect to either pregnancy or abortion. Despite the new claims of some gender activists, men cannot get pregnant. A law prohibiting abortion does not, therefore, treat men and women differently or, put in the Pennsylvania ERA’s terms, discriminate against women on account of their sex. No matter. The court obviously wanted to reach a particular result, and neither the text of the Pennsylvania Constitution nor its own previous interpretation of that text would stand in the way. Chief Justice Debra Todd dissented, not only arguing that no justification existed for overruling Fischer but observing that, in reality, the case did not properly involve the right to abortion at all. The differential treatment, if any existed, was between two classes of women – those giving birth and those seeking abortion – rather than between men and women. The U.S. Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade in June 2022, holding what anyone reading the Constitution would know, that it “does not confer a right to abortion.” No wonder abortion activists are again pushing for ratification of the ERA while trying in vain to cover their tracks. This Pennsylvania decision shows not only that abortion advocates will use any means at their disposal to promote it, but that they would do the same for the country if the ERA ever became part of the U.S. Constitution."},

Unfortunately, tens of thousands federal employees are being put to a similar test by the Biden administration. But instead of being required to deny basic math, they are being forced to deny basic biology under radical \"gender identity\" policies. On International Transgender Day of Visibility, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management ordered federal agencies to prohibit the intentional use of \"incorrect\" pronouns in the workplace because it could contribute to an \"unlawful hostile work environment.\" First to comply were the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of State and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (USCBP), all of which have recently issued workplace pronoun mandates. Not surprisingly, the administration’s LGBT advocate-in-chief, Assistant Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine, announced the policy for HHS. Although Levine is a biological male (and for decades went by Richard), HHS employees are prohibited from using anything other than \"she\" when speaking of Levine and all other trans-identifying biological males at HHS. Further, because the policy covers \"gender non-conforming, agender, \"gender fluid\" or \"non-binary\" identifications, biologically male employees can retain male names and dress and appear like a man on any given day, and still demand to be addressed as she, xir, or they. >>> The Fight Against Gender Ideology Needs Strong Parents, Leaders, and Laws Not to be outdone, the USCBP issued a memo for Border Patrol agents prohibiting them from addressing persons they catch illegally crossing the border as \"Mr., Mrs., Ms., Sir [or] Ma’am\" until they ask, \"can you please confirm your pronouns or gender identity?\" and then adopting whatever the immigrant says. To drive the point home, the memo states agents may not offer \"personal opinions\" on these matters or \"refer to being LGBTQI+ as a ‘choice’ or ‘lifestyle.’\" But shutting up about one’s beliefs, as bad as that is, is not actually an option because pronoun use is part of life and practically unavoidable. There will be no hiding or laying low on this one, everyone will be found out eventually. Perhaps most offensive of all, under OPM guidance, all federal facilities with showers and changing rooms must now be opened to people of the opposite sex based on their say-so. Surely many women who enjoy working out at the office gym will object to seeing grown men getting naked in front of them in the lockers. While the policy (at least as implemented by HHS) acknowledges some people may \"feel uncomfortable\" with this certain eventuality, it clarifies that it is objecting biological women who must leave the facilities in this situation, not the other way around. There was a time when a boss allowing men to undress in front of female employees was considered 100% automatic sexual harassment. But now the federal government is treating it more like a job requirement and will label you a bigot if you object. Federal employees are not defenseless. They should file lawsuits seeking to block enforcement of these illegal policies under the Free Speech Clause and Title VII at the very least. And those who believe that sexual human embodiment is part of God’s design should also file claims under the Free Exercise Clause and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and request religious accommodation. >>> States May Protect Minors by Banning “Gender-Affirming Care” Totalitarians throughout history have demanded that the people they subjugate repeat sanctioned lies as a way to secure their power. If those in power can make you say with your own lips that men are women, or neither, or both, and back again, they can make you say and do anything, including drafting you into the pronoun police to spy and inform on your coworkers. Eighty years ago, the Supreme Court said, \"If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.\" Back then the issue was whether government schools could require students to pledge allegiance to the American flag, while today the question is whether the Biden administration can force Americans to pledge allegiance to the rainbow flag. The answer to that question should be no, but as always, our liberties only become effective when people have the courage to stand up for the truth and their right to remain free, even if it comes at a cost."},

Despite the fact that these social transitions almost invariably lead to later medical interventions, these schools insist on accommodating students by using their requested pronouns, new names, preferred bathrooms, and more. In most cases, school leadership instructs staff to actively lie to parents if the school deems the parents to be “unsupportive” of their child's gender identity. These policies are often boosted by child welfare proposals like California's AB 957. If that bill is signed, as Governor Gavin Newsom has promised, California judges will be required to consider whether a parent “affirms” a child's “gender identity” during custody battles. Together with opaque school gender policies, it's not too difficult to imagine blue states moving to take care and custody away from gender-critical parents who are desperately trying to save their children from school systems that rush down the path toward medical intervention. Such breathtaking interference with parent-child relationships is not only illegal, it is immoral. For 100 years, the Supreme Court has recognized parents' fundamental, constitutional right to direct the upbringing of their own children. As recently as 2000, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority in Troxel v. Granville, stated that the liberty interest of parents in the care, custody, and control of their children “is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court.\" >>> More Courts Uphold Bans on “Gender-Affirming” Care for Minors. Is Supreme Court Next Stop? Beyond the violation of the Constitution's implicit right to govern one's minor children, though, these school policies may violate other federal laws as well. These include the First Amendment's prohibition on compelled speech and its guarantee of free exercise for students or administrators whose beliefs diverge from a school's prevailing leftist gender orthodoxy but are nevertheless required to use preferred pronouns; the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which gives parents the right to inspect the information in their child's education records—including any and all gender identity or related mental health data—whether held by the state, the local district, or school; and the Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment, which gives parents the right to opt out their children from participation in federally funded surveys, instruction, or evaluations used to elicit answers on sensitive questions concerning sexual behavior and attitudes, mental or psychological diagnoses, and more. Parenting one's own children is not just an interest protected by federal law, it is a universal and inalienable precept that pre-dates government itself. That this conversation is even necessary is a function of how far we've fallen. Throughout human history, the primacy of parents in the lives of their minor children and their ability to raise their children without interference has reflected our natural inclination toward that which is proper, moral, and reasonable. The Supreme Court's rulings are ultimately based on this natural right. As Justice James McReynolds wrote in Pierce v. Society of Sisters: “the child is not the mere creature of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare him for additional obligations.” Years later, Justice Wiley Rutledge reinforced that idea, writing that: “It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents.” And in 1972, Justice Warren E. Burger made things extremely clear: “The history and culture of Western civilization reflect a strong tradition of parental concern for the nurture and upbringing of their children. This primary role of the parents in the upbringing of their children is now established beyond debate as an enduring American tradition.” The White House has ignored all this, of course, claiming that America's children belong to “all of us.” Indeed, for the Left and Big Education, this narrative is essential. It is the opening salvo in the immoral effort to facilitate minors' gender identity changes—with or without their parents' knowledge. >>> House Panel Hears From Gender Medicine’s “Dr. Frankenstein” on His Insane Surgical Option for Minors This collectivist notion not only runs contrary to the American Constitution and almost every society's historical understanding of parental rights; it has real consequences for real Americans. Take the tragic case of Sage, a Virginia high school girl. When Sage started attending Appomattox County High School in 2021, she assumed a newfound male identity and requested accommodations from the school. The school provided these accommodations and concealed Sage's new identity from her parents. Not long after, Sage suffered a psychotic episode and fled, only to be raped and sex trafficked in four different states. Upon her rescue by federal authorities, a Baltimore city official argued that Sage's parents were not “sufficiently affirming” of her new identity and assigned her to an all-male juvenile facility. There, she was sexually assaulted yet again. Sage's mother has filed a federal lawsuit against the school, but we should all be outraged. No matter how often progressive educators claim to know what's best for our children, federal law—and the beating heart of every parent—know better."},

But based on the U.S. Supreme Court’s century-old recognition of parents’ fundamental, constitutional right to direct the upbringing of their children, it hasn’t taken long for those policies to elicit federal legal challenges. Parents in at least six states have done so, but a recent federal court decision halting such a policy doesn’t bode well for school administrators keen to keep parents in the dark about something so fundamental. A few days ago, in Mirabelli v. Olson, California U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez preliminarily enjoined the Escondido Union School District’s (EUSD) confidentiality policy on behalf of two plaintiff teachers at Rincon Middle School. Elizabeth Mirabelli and Lori Ann West sued EUSD, the California State Board of Education, and State Superintendent, among others, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, a federal law that provides a cause of action for individuals whose constitutional rights are violated by state or local government officials. The lawsuit claimed that the defendants violated the plaintiffs’ rights under the Constitution’s Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses based on a policy that enforced faculty confidentiality and non-disclosure regarding a student’s newly expressed gender identification. According to plaintiffs, the policy allowed activists to “coopt school districts to push gender theory.” In his order, Benitez wrote that “a parent’s right to make decisions concerning the care, custody, control, and medical care of their [sic] children is one of the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests that Americans enjoy.” And because teachers who revealed students’ transgender status to “individuals who do not have a legitimate need for the information” would be considered to have engaged in discriminatory harassment, “Mirabelli and West face an unlawful choice along the lines of ‘lose your faith and keep your job, or keep your faith and lose your job.’” >>> Hiding Students’ Gender Identities From Their Parents Is Immoral Benitez called the policy a “trifecta of harm,” and detailed how the Parental Exclusion Policy: But Judge Paul Grimm ruled in favor of the school district and dismissed the suit. In assessing the constitutionality of the policy, he concluded that the parents lacked a fundamental right under the 14th Amendment to be “promptly informed of their child’s gender identity, when it differs from that usually associated with their sex assigned at birth,” regardless of their child’s wishes or the detrimental effect the disclosure might have on that child. The 4th Circuit upheld the trial court’s dismissal of plaintiffs’ lawsuit last month, but it did so for a lack of standing—something not raised by the school district at the trial level. Writing the majority opinion for the divided three-judge panel, Judge Marvin Quattlebaum wrote that the parents had not alleged a concrete injury sufficient to confer Article III standing as required by the Constitution and could prove nothing more than a “speculative fear” that they would be impacted by the policy. Specifically, Quattlebaum noted that the parents could not demonstrate their children had gender support plans, were at increased risk of transitioning, or had had any discussions with school officials about gender identity or gender-transition issues. >>> More Courts Uphold Bans on “Gender-Affirming” Care for Minors. Is Supreme Court Next Stop? He urged them to seek a remedy at the ballot box. Judge Paul Niemeyer dissented, pointing to the Supreme Court’s decision in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District. In that case, the Court found that plaintiffs had standing to challenge assessing the constitutionality of policies geared toward racially balanced school districts even though the alleged harm depended on a chain of future events. Niemeyer argued that the majority’s reading of the parents’ complaint was unfairly narrow and subjected all parents in the district to the mandatory school policy without any avenue of redress, even though their fundamental parenting rights had—simply by virtue of the policy’s express design in circumventing parental involvement—already been infringed. Parents’ primary right and responsibility to direct the upbringing of their children is both longstanding in law and ancient in origin.

The answer is...gender ideology.", "In rooting out applicants with the “wrong” religious beliefs, DCF ignored its own regulations. ", "Foster children have already endured enough trauma; they should not be collateral damage in the war over gender ideology."], "text": "Religious freedom, Congress said unanimously in 1998, “undergirds the very origin and existence of the United States.” Today, however, an obsession with gender ideology is driving governments to ignore the First Amendment, defy clear Supreme Court precedent, and even violate their own laws and regulations to root out those with the “wrong” religious views about sexuality. This bigotry not only violates fundamental rights, but it also puts vulnerable children at risk. During the 2021-22 fiscal year, more than 9,700 children were placed in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families, which had already acknowledged a serious lack of both foster families and group homes. While DCF does not publish an official number, reports began to emerge that abused and neglected children removed from their homes who had no place to stay ended up sleeping in social workers’ offices, sometimes for nights at a time. Other foster children were forced to stay in hospitals or emergency rooms because no other placements were available. Especially in the middle of this crisis, what could possibly be more important than finding families who could provide a safe and loving home for foster kids? The answer is the same thing that drives disastrous business decisions, dangerous educational practices, and media self-censorship: gender ideology. Here’s what Massachusetts is doing. Mike and Kitty Burke are lifelong residents of Springfield, Massachusetts. Mike is an Iraq War veteran, and Kitty has experience working with special needs children. After finding they could not bear their own children, the Burkes applied to be foster parents, successfully completing training and going through extensive interviews and an evaluation of the home environment in which foster kids would live. DCF, however, rejected their application solely because of their religious beliefs, as faithful Catholics, about sexuality and marriage. DCF regulations require foster families to “support and respect a child’s sexual orientation and gender identity” but, unfortunately, do not further define what this means. The Burkes’ objective qualifications and commitment to accept, love, and care for children regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity was not enough. During their foster parent training, the Burkes were told that foster parents must actually affirm same-sex relationships and transgender identities, a requirement that apparently extends to their own personal beliefs. The home interviewer recommended against allowing the Burkes to foster children “due to the couple’s views. … They are heavily involved in their Catholic Church and cite their religious views” as the basis for how they look at sexuality and marriage. In the end, DCF rejected the Burkes because of their “beliefs.” In rooting out applicants with the “wrong” religious beliefs, DCF ignored its own regulations. DCF’s Foster Parents’ Bill of Rights, for example, prohibits discrimination against prospective foster parents “on the basis of religion,” and its regulations claim that it “does not deny any adult the opportunity to become a foster family on the basis of … religion.” Tell that to the Burkes. DCF policy supposedly prevents staff from “imposing their personal, cultural, and/or religious beliefs on children and families involved with the Department.” At the same time, DCF makes this very imposition more likely by leaving key determinations about applicants’ fitness to a social worker’s unfettered subjective discretion. Here, DCF rejected the Burkes because, as the primary social worker assigned to their application put it, their “faith is not supportive” of every child’s sexual orientation and gender identity. DCF claims to prioritize applicants willing to care for sibling groups, children from diverse racial or ethnic backgrounds, and those with special needs. The Burkes checked all of those boxes, and evaluators noted that Mike’s experience of PTSD following his military service and Kitty’s work with special needs children would enhance their effectiveness as foster parents. The Burkes even said they were open to adopting foster children who could not be reunified with their birth families. Still not good enough. In a way, DCF’s discrimination is worse than if it had simply excluded all people of faith. DCF, you see, claims to recruit foster families from diverse faith communities. No, DCF discriminates among religious families, rejecting those with religious beliefs that the state finds objectionable. In other words, Catholics (as well as Muslims and many Jews and Protestants) have a shot only if they reject their church or faith tradition’s teachings on sexual orientation and gender identity. DCF not only disregarded its own policies and regulations, it also ignored the U.S. Constitution and several recent Supreme Court decisions interpreting it: The desperate need of children, DCF’s own policies and regulations, and even clear Supreme Court directives are not enough to hinder gender warriors in Massachusetts. Foster children have already endured enough trauma; they should not be collateral damage in the war over gender ideology. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

Now, the authorities are investigating Christopher Rufo, a conservative commentator who is on the board of the New College of Florida, for—among other crimes—refusing to address someone as “ze/zir.” Yes, this is happening. Neither “ze” nor “zir” are words in the English language, or any other language. They are inventions by far-left gender ideologues who insist they are “neo-pronouns” that must now be used in place of the third-person singular “he” or “she” for those who say they are of unspecified sex—also something that doesn’t exist, except for people born with a rare biological condition. >>> Defining SEX Act The Biden administration not only agrees with this lunacy but is prepared to use the full force of the law to enforce it. If the ideological implications of this current drift are daunting, so are the political ramifications. Rufo, a well-known documentary-maker, activist, and author, was appointed to the Sarasota-based college’s board of trustees by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, specifically to clean up this type of gender nonsense. DeSantis is a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, and the investigation arrives as the leading GOP candidate, former President Donald Trump, battles multiple indictments. Biden’s Education and Justice departments have launched investigations into New College of Florida and Rufo—to which Rufo links in a Substack post, portions of which he also posted on X, formerly known as Twitter. The Education Department said it decided to launch the investigation after a complaint from unnamed “students, faculty and staff” who allege that Rufo and the other trustees violated civil rights law. The agency did so, according to a letter to New College’s interim president, because the students’ complaint contained a litany of alleged violations of civil rights law. The complaint, included in the Education Department’s letter, accuses the college’s board of such transgressions as removing signs that said “gender neutral” from bathrooms; lowering academic standards so the college could admit more men, and “misgendering” the former head of the college’s department of diversity, equity, and inclusion, Yoleidy Rosario-Hernandez (whom the board fired) when Rufo referred to her as “she” instead of her chosen personal pronouns of ze and zir. The Education Department also accused the college’s board, among many other things, of the “removal of all-inclusive and diversity-focused content from admissions marketing materials and the college’s website” and canceling “the Africana Studies Living Learning Community (LLC) in January or February of 2023 and changed the name of the Pride LLC to ‘Great Books.’” One of the complaints, incredibly, was that Rufo had “mocked” Hernandez. “You know what, I did mock her,” Rufo, a friend, told me in a conversation last Tuesday night at the Washington launch of “America’s Cultural Revolution,“ his new bestselling book. “Her pronouns are ridiculous. They are trying to make mockery illegal.” This is an important point, as ridicule is one of the most powerful weapons in the war of ideas now being waged in America. Nobody knew this better than Saul Alinsky, the founder of American community organizing and one of the leftists who launched the opening salvos of this war. “Ridicule is man’s most potent weapon. It is almost impossible to counterattack ridicule. Also, it infuriates the opposition, who then react to your advantage,” Alinsky wrote in his 1971 book “Rules for Radicals.” Thus, the Biden administration is trying to make it a crime to say that the gender and racial emperor has no clothes. >>> What Is Gender Ideology? But Rufo’s next point was even more pressing. “What they are doing is making opposition to their orthodoxy illegal,” he said. “What this is is an inside-outside game. Activists outside the Department of Education are colluding with activists inside.” And this is where we are right now in America. Rufo is, in the words of the leftist publication Vox, “the Right’s leading culture warrior.” Vox hurls that as an insult; I agree with it and see it as praise. By attempting to silence Rufo, the Biden administration is trying to stamp out all possible criticism of or opposition to the race and sexual theories that have become government writ, something imposed by force of law not just domestically, but also overseas. It’s not Biden necessarily who is doing any of this. The president is a Delaware politician who, in his many decades of government, never gave any sign of supporting any of this nonsense. It is the activists inside his administration, who seem to have control, who are obviously imposing obeisance to the new orthodoxy. The attacks on political opponents are, of course, another matter."},

"], "text": "Why are so many of our institutions captured by people on the fringes of the cultural Left? Two new books, one by Christopher Rufo and another by Richard Hanania, offer comprehensive answers to that question. But a recent study by two economists at West Virginia University provides a microcosmic example of how cultural leftists keep a grip on their power in universities: They discriminate in favor of their own. No, this isn’t a study about suppressing conservative speech on campuses. This sort of discrimination is much more subtle. The study, “Gender Identity and Access to Higher Education,” found that college admissions counselors give preferential treatment to emails from people with pronouns in their signature lines. The authors of the study sent emails to college admissions counselors at 500 randomly selected colleges and universities in the United States. Some of the emails included pronouns in the signature line—“he/him,” “she/her,” or “xe/xem.” Those who did received responses 4% more often than those who did not. There was no statistical difference in the speed of replies or in the number of words included in a reply, which suggested that “the decision was whether to respond, and [pronouns] did not affect the eagerness to respond.” But admissions officers’ responses to pronoun users tended to be different than to non-users. Responses to pronoun users were “more positive” and “friendlier,” including “heightened use of exclamation marks and emojis.” Admissions officers used exclamation marks 10.5% more often with pronoun users and used emojis 141.7% more often with pronoun users. Pronoun non-users tended to receive “strictly factual replies.” What follows are some representative examples of the trend. The economists sent an identical email asking about the timing and delivery of decision letters to three admissions officers. The first two emails included pronouns, the third did not. Here are the responses: It was noteworthy that the economists did not find a preference for nonbinary people (represented by “xe/xem” pronouns), but rather a fairly uniform preference for anyone who uses pronouns. Thus, the economists concluded that the data suggest “that agents of higher education institutions hold a preference for progressively minded individuals.” The institutions most likely to discriminate tend to be medium to large, based in cities, and have low retention rates and a large proportion of students receiving need-based financial aid. The economists note that by giving pronoun users preferential treatment, admissions counselors make it easier for those applicants to gain admission. In economic parlance, they “decrease the transaction costs” of the application process. Admissions officers’ preferential treatment also has the effect of promoting their institutions to pronoun users above others. If you follow this logic one step further, the end result is that pronoun users will have an easier time getting through the application process and will tend to feel more welcome at a school than non-users will. It may be a small effect in the grand scheme of things, but it’s only one small effect among thousands of similar effects. And just as thousands of raindrops will fill a bucket, thousands of little discriminations will fill a university with the preferred sort of student.

"], "text": "It’s becoming harder and harder for high school and college girls to compete against other females without intrusion by transgender-identified males. To see just how far we have fallen in refusing to recognize the fundamental injustice of allowing these males to compete against biological females, consider some historic scandals in the Olympic Games. Once, everyone from the organizers of the Olympics to every national athletic association to every high school gym teacher understood that the biological differences between men and women gave well-trained male athletes an inherent advantage over their similarly well-trained female athletes. These biological distinctions are not insignificant. Males have greater lung capacity, larger hearts, more bone density, and more muscle mass—advantages which allow them to jump higher, throw further, run and accelerate faster, and punch harder than females. One recent study revealed that in the sports where upper body strength dominates, males possess more than a 50% athletic advantage over their female counterparts. This athletic gap emerges around age 12 when males experience a 20-fold boost in testosterone. >>> Title IX and the Biden Administration’s Assault on Women’s Sports That is why the rules governing sporting competitions—especially those considered to be at the pinnacle of athletic achievement such as the Olympic Games—long maintained strict prohibitions on female athletes taking male hormones and other kinds of performance-enhancing drugs for both male and female athletes. From the 1960s through the 1980s, East German Olympic athletes “swam their way to glory, winning Olympic gold medals, setting world records.” It was only after the fall of the Iron Curtain that the secret to their success was revealed: an elaborate, organized doping system that fed hormones and steroids to the athletes, including the female swimmers, intended to enhance their performance and give their female swimmers a distinct athletic advantage of the kind only found in their male counterparts. The Russian government has been caught doing the same thing multiple times with the same hormone-doping system as the East Germans had. Last year, Kamila Valieva, a 15-year-old Russian figure skater who won a gold medal in the Beijing Olympic Games, tested positive for Trimetazidine, a drug classified by the World Anti-Doping Agency under “hormone and metabolic modulators.” Today, liberal pundits seem to have forgotten history. They’re willing to turn a blind eye to the universal disapproval of hormone use at all levels of national and international athletic contests. It’s not hypocrisy, apparently, when we normalize allowing male-bodied athletes with overwhelming athletic advantages to compete in women’s sports, but sanction female athletes like Marion Jones, a standout winner at the 2000 Sydney Games, for using performance-enhancing drugs. Jones admitted in 2007 to lying to federal agents about her use of those drugs, spent six months in jail, and was stripped of all five of her Olympic medals by the International Olympic Committee. But now a new rule has emerged in sports: men that psychologically feel like women can compete with all the physiological advantages rendered them by accident of birth against real women. However, real women get the book thrown at them for taking performance-enhancing drugs that give them the same advantages that biological males develop naturally in contests against their own. >>> Hiding Students’ Gender Identities From Their Parents Is Immoral So much for equality. The future of female athletics is on unstable ground. The inclusion of men competing as women is greeted with nods of approval from liberal elites, cultural Marxists, leftist politicos, and gender ideologues at home and abroad. The evisceration of spaces where the enduring differences between the sexes are most on display is, for trans-evangelists, their brass ring. As goes sport, so goes the rest of the gender contagion. This generation’s greatest “doping” scandal seems to be just getting started, but it is already cheating high school and college girls out of medals, awards, and the athletic scholarships they use to pay for their educations. Now is the time to divest fake females of their titles, and call an end to athletic fraud. It is a matter of common sense, fundamental justice, and the important principle of fair play in sports that—up until now—has been a hallmark of our culture."},

Linn Mar Community School District. A three-judge panel of the court overruled a district court and instructed it to issue a preliminary injunction against enforcement of a school board policy in Iowa that would have disciplined students for expressing opinions that diverge from leftist gender orthodoxy—specifically, for refusing to “respect” a student’s gender identity. In April 2022, the Linn Mar school district board passed a policy intended to “address the needs of transgender students, gender-expansive students, nonbinary, gender nonconforming students, and students questioning their gender.” The policy prohibited school administrators, teachers and counselors from informing parents that their children were having to cooperate with or were undergoing “gender support” accommodations for transgender students “regarding names, pronouns, restroom and locker facilities, overnight accommodations on school trips, and participation in activities.” >>> Liberal Hypocrites Are Destroying Women’s Sports Any refusal to “respect a student’s gender identity” would violate the school’s prohibitions against bullying and harassment, which could lead to suspension and expulsion. Gender identity was defined by the favorite psychobabble of progressives—namely, a student’s “deeply-held sense or psychological knowledge of their own gender.” Parents Defending Education sued on behalf of parents with students in the Linn Mar system. They claimed violations of the First and 14th amendments for violations of their substantive due process right “to direct the care, custody, and control of their children” and violation of “their children’s right to freedom of speech.” Fortunately, the school board’s secrecy provision was overridden when the Iowa General Assembly passed a bill, signed by the governor, in the middle of the litigation that prohibited school districts from hiding information from parents or giving them “false or misleading information” about a student’s “gender identity or intention to transition to a gender” different from what is listed on his or her birth certificate. The new law requires school administrators to notify parents of a student’s request for “gender accommodation.” As for the First Amendment claim, the court determined that at least one student in particular was being prevented from speaking his mind out of fear that he would be disciplined, thus giving him and his parents standing to sue. The school board‘s contemptuous attitude toward the free-speech rights of students was evident. As the 8th Circuit summarized in its opinion, one of the parents explained that her son wanted to “state his belief that biological sex in immutable,” disagree “with another student’s assertion about whether they are male or female,” state that biological males should not be allowed to compete in female athletics, and express “discomfort about sharing bathrooms with teachers or students of the opposite biological sex.” Yet the school board argued that “the suggested activity” and speech of the student was not “affected with a constitutional interest” because “harassment or bullying on the basis of gender is not protected speech within the school environment.” Fortunately, the appeals court didn’t buy it: “A school district cannot avoid the strictures of the First Amendment simply by defining certain speech as ‘bullying’ or ‘harassment.’” The court concluded that the parents would likely succeed in their claim that inflicting punishment on students for failing to “respect a student’s gender identity” is “void for vagueness” and thus a violation of the First Amendment. >>> Hiding Students’ Gender Identities From Their Parents Is Immoral A “government policy,” the court said, is “unconstitutionally vague if it fails to ‘provide adequate notice of the proscribed conduct’ and lends ‘itself to arbitrary enforcement.’” The failure of the school board to define “respect,” the court concluded, means that the policy could cover any speech about gender identity that a school administrator deems “disrespectful” of another student’s gender identity. Students cannot know whether they are violating the policy when expressing discomfort about sharing a bathroom with someone who is transgender, argues that biological sex is immutable in a debate in social studies class, or expresses an opinion about the participation of transgender students on single-sex athletic teams. Moreover, the lack of clarity over the meaning of “respect” left the policy open to differing interpretations by teachers and administrators and created a “substantial risk” of arbitrary enforcement. The school board has the right to appeal this decision by either asking for an en banc review, which is when the entire appeals court reviews the case, or to go directly to the Supreme Court to ask it to review the decision. What the school board should do instead is realize that it made a grievous error in implementing this restrictive, unconstitutional policy and get rid of it in its entirety."},

Just look what they’ve done to women’s sports. Their forebears in the movement would be appalled. Once the promises of voting and property rights had been fulfilled by the early suffragettes—the Mary Wollstonecrafts and the Susan B. Anthonys—the second-wave feminists turned their attention to other iterations of sex equality. The Gloria Steinems and the Bella Abzugs burned their bras in the streets, descended on Capitol Hill, and demanded equal employment, equal pay, and equal educational opportunity. Their crowning achievement was perhaps Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972—the federal civil rights law guaranteeing sex equality in education in all its many manifestations, whether admissions, scholarships, graduate programs, housing accommodations, or athletics. What a difference a half-century makes. To watch the patent discrimination extant in women’s sporting events these days, you’d be hard pressed to think Title IX exists at all. For this, we have third-wave feminists to thank, those who have sacrificed women’s equality on the altar of equity for trans-identified males. They believe gender is performative, that the coherence of gender expression is illusory, that one’s “natural sex” is transitory. These feminists—the Judith Butlers and Gloria Anzaldúas—gifted us the poison of “queer theory,” and set up a battle of the sexes playing out in real time in high school gymnasiums everywhere. >>> Yes, Lia Thomas’s Body Is the Problem These same feminists have fed us the narrative that divisions over transgender athletic participation are based not on the fulsome evidence of the athletic advantages of transgender-identified males, but rather on “our deeply-held and rather largely unexamined assumptions about biology and gender.” But if the widely recognized proof of male athletic advantages isn’t sufficient for third-wave feminists to call an end to men in women’s sports, perhaps evidence of injured female athletes will be. These injuries sustained by girls and women during athletic contests with transgender athletes are not the stuff of mere speculation. Significant bodily harm to young women is already well-documented, and on the rise. Take a recent game between the Collegiate Charter School of Lowell in Massachusetts and KIPP Academy in Lynn, Massachusetts. A trans-identified six-foot-tall male player with facial hair playing for the KIPP Academy girls’ basketball team, injured multiple players and eventually forced the Collegiate Charter School to forfeit. In now widely circulated video, he is seen wrestling the ball away from one of the girls, causing her to hit the ground where she clutches her back in pain. Events like these are no longer an aberration in school sports, thanks to Education Secretary Miguel Cordona’s illegal interpretation of “sex” in Title IX to also include “gender identity or expression.” Indeed, they are evidence that this new wave of sex discrimination has not yet reached its zenith. In 2022, North Carolina volleyball player Payton McNabb suffered serious injury after a trans-identified male player spiked a ball at her head and rendered her unconscious. Last year, a female athlete was injured by a trans-identified male opponent during a field hockey game in Massachusetts when a ball he threw at her, knocking her teeth out. >>> Women’s Sports on the Chopping Block Examples of other females being injured by males participating in overseas or semi-professional women’s sports abound, occurring in soccer, rugby, hockey, and mixed martial arts. And these injuries are just the ones we know about; the political overlords at legacy media companies who are fully beholden to the trans minority have surely kept others quiet. Where, now, is the feminist outrage of our grandmothers? Where the dismay of the third-wave feminists at what their prescriptions on intersectionality and queerness have wrought? How many more female athletes must be injured before a new wave of feminists rise up—those with the first wave’s understanding of moral order and natural law, possessed of the outrage and unflinching demands for equality of the second wave? We modern women—we who have held the vote for little more than 100 years, considered by many segments of male society for centuries to be little more than skin and bones—must recognize the third wave has failed us and ceded ground it took our grandmothers and great grandmothers years to claim. We must never cease to believe our own eyes, call out discrimination where it hides in plain sight, and identify the chauvinism platformed by commitments to “queerness,” and equity, and the fungibility of sex—something even arch feminist Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg wrote was “not fungible.” We must do these things, if not for our own sake, then for that of those women yet to come."},

But the consequences of the university's decision wouldn't be limited to unfair competition. Although Thomas' teammates were told he would use separate locker-room facilities, he was instead allowed to use the same locker-room as the rest of the team, subjecting the all-female group to changing clothes in front of a man. This incident, and the University of Pennsylvania's intense crackdown on dissent, sparked many of its athletes to come forward and advocate for the future of women's sports. Paula Scanlan, a former University of Pennsylvania swimmer and teammate of Thomas, is the latest guest on The Kevin Roberts Show. Inspired by the injustice that she and her fellow Penn teammates suffered, Scanlan now spends her time making sure that the future of women's sports is safe, and that no one has to go through her experience ever again. Despite being part of the most pessimistic generation in American history, Scanlan fights to give hope to the millions of girls who use sports to pursue the American dream. Paula Scanlan: There was a girl on the team who was a bio major, she was very liberal when she said, “I’m a biology major and I understand biology. I don’t think this is fair. Show me that one-on-one.” She would never admit that to anybody else, and I’m obviously not going to name her. There was conversations like that you could have all the time with people. But when you’d come to the group, the whole entire group would say, “No. Of course I’m supportive. This is the most amazing thing that’s happening. This is progress.” Kevin Roberts: Welcome back to the Kevin Roberts Show. I’d say this every week, and I mean that this week’s guest is really special. You’re going to want to tune into every minute of this interview. Sometimes I say that and it’s about an elected official. And when I say that about an elected official, it’s true. It’s true every time. But as I was just explaining to our friend of Heritage and guest this week, it’s even better not to have an elected official this week. No disrespect to those men and women who are doing some really important things. But what we’re trying to do with the show this week is highlight the courage of everyday Americans like you. And so, this fellow American sitting with me at Heritage right now is someone I think you’re going to enjoy hearing more from. Our new friend, Paula Scanlan, thanks for joining me. Scanlan: Thank you so much for having me. Roberts: So how in the wide world of sports do you find yourself in Washington, DC today doing something that you’re happy to be doing, but you probably would prefer to be doing something else? Scanlan: Yeah, so the backstory is I was a member of a swim team at the University of Pennsylvania where a male individual decided they wanted to join the women’s team. And that opened my eyes up to silencing, there’s free speech violations going on, there’s all these actions that have showed us that one individual that identified as a female was more important than the rest of the team. And of course, I would love to not be here and not have to talk about this. I would’ve loved to never have gone through it. But now that I have, I think it’s my place to elaborate on what I went through and show the world that we can’t allow this to happen. Roberts: Well, first of all, thank you for being here. Thank you for your courage even though as you told me off camera, it’s not really courage. My rejoinder to you, as you no doubt remember is, a lot of courageous people say that. And so thank you for your humility, which I think is going to motivate you in all the things you do in life. But this show is going to be focused on what happened, not necessarily the detail unless you want to get into that, but what happened, like starting with that moment when you realize, “Oh my gosh,” not just that this is wrong and shouldn’t be happening, but that you decided you’re going to speak out about it. So you start swimming when you’re young, eight years old? Scanlan: Yep. I was eight. Roberts: And I gather you’re swimming at the University of Pennsylvania. You were good. And this is one of your life pursuits. And in addition to your academic pursuits and whatever you may want to do with your vocation, which I want to talk to you about, swimming is vital to who you are as it should be because of your achievement. You get to Penn and this situation happens. What’s the first thing that occurs to you when you learn that a man is going to be allowed to swim on the Women’s swim team? Scanlan: I was in shock. I think that’s the best way to explain. So the backstory is this didn’t happen until the fall of 2021 where the news stories didn’t even start until December, November of 2021. My team knew from September of 2019 that this was going to be happening to us. And COVID actually prolonged that an additional year. It would’ve been the season before. And I found out, we were told in a team meeting, it was a five-minute meeting, it was led by a member of the men’s team named Will Thomas at the time. Will just informed us that they had started a protocol and would be joining the women’s team the following season, the year from that date. And that was it. There was no questions. There was no Q&A. The coach didn’t even talk. It was just Will telling us that, said, “My pronouns now are she/her. Please respect them. Everybody get in the pool. That was it.” There was no conversation. I was in shock. I couldn’t really focus that practice. I went home after practice and went to dinner with some friends who weren’t on the team, and I could not stop talking about it. And they were like, “That doesn’t sound real. That’s not happening.” Roberts: They probably didn’t believed you. Scanlan: “There’s no way.” They didn’t believe me. There were people looking things up saying, “That’s not something that happens.” I called my family, they said the same thing. They said, “That won’t happen. Someone will shut it down. Someone will make sure it doesn’t happen.” But of course, nobody stepped up. Nobody stepped in. And the season happened two years later. And it could have been avoided in those two years somehow. They could have done studies, they could have changed the protocols, but they didn’t. Roberts: And there’s no conversation that your coach was initiating with your team about this in the meantime? Scanlan: No, we were just told that was what was going to happen and there was no conversation about it, which I thought was very interesting because it was something that was definitely going to be controversial and no one agreed that it was controversial. And I found that to me was my first instinct that things were going to be bad. You should talk about something like that. Even if you don’t agree with my opinion, even if I don’t agree with your opinion, that’s something we need to talk about as a team, and we never did. Roberts: The remarkable thing among many about the transgender agenda is that it transcends the conservative versus liberal, Republican versus Democrat vector, right? I mean, this is just a common sense issue. But in spite of that, I’m thinking about the silence of your coach. I’m wondering if other teammates were willing to commiserate with you even privately about what was going on. Or was there this expectation that y’all were just to accept it and move on? Scanlan: So you could have private conversations with people. I met with a lot of people that in the future later ended up telling the entire team they were so supportive and hated everyone who spoke out against it. But there was a girl on the team who was a bio major and she told me... She was very liberal when she said, “I’m a biology major and I understand biology. I don’t think this is fair. Show me that one-on-one.” She would never admit that to anybody else. And I’m obviously not going to name her. But there was conversations like that you could have all the time with people, but when you’d come to the group, the whole entire group would say, “No, of course I’m supportive. This is the most amazing thing that’s happening. This is progress. This is what we want for the world. This is helping transgender individuals mend into society,” whatever. And privately they would say things that were different. So that was something that I had a really hard time because I didn’t know who to trust because they could tell me their opinion and then five minutes later, they’re telling the entire group that they hate me and they disagree with my opinion. Roberts: We’re going to get into, no doubt, the situation of being in a locker room and swimming with a man on a women’s team. But first, I just kind of want to get a sense of the context. Was there anything on campus at the University of Pennsylvania that made you think that somehow this was going to be fixed before you actually had to enter a locker room with him? Scanlan: Honestly, no. Based on- Roberts: I was afraid you were going to say that. Scanlan: Based on everything that I had seen from the way the university handled most things, it didn’t seem like they cared enough about protecting of the greater good. Colleges have really turned into this place where everyone who’s LGBT+ is the top priority and minorities. And they make it very clear that anyone who has a dissenting viewpoint is not welcomed. And I saw this firsthand in the spring of 2019 when Candace Owens came to talk at campus. And I went to her speech, there were riots, there were people screaming at her calling her a racist, and they were white students and she’s Black. I thought it was so backwards. Everybody who was in attendance to her speaking was screaming over her, so you couldn’t even hear her talking. And I think I knew that if the university couldn’t get that under control to even allow a conservative speaker to have a voice, I was not hopeful that they were going to listen to our team. Roberts: And I imagine that there was nothing going on inside classrooms regardless of the subject that made you think that there would be professors or mid-ranking administrators who on their own would stand up for, again, something that shouldn’t just be conservative. It’s just common sense. Just knowing higher ed well, that probably wasn’t anything you could count on. Scanlan: Yeah. And actually, there was an instance of a professor that they wrote a smear piece about in our school newspaper because he wrote an article that they didn’t like the viewpoint of. And he actually... I don’t know if he was fired or if he was removed from the university or if he left on his own volition. I think it was kind of a “Please leave or you’re fired” situation. And I’m actually connected with him now, and I do speak to him a little bit about this stuff and the treatment of the school. He’s great and he’s a great resource in all of this, but he was removed from his position for just... Not even voicing his opinions and saying, “I’m comfortable with everybody having an open viewpoint.” That’s not acceptable anymore. Roberts: Yeah. This isn’t someone, a professor, this person you’re talking about, who’s waving the flag for red meat conservative Republican politics, right? He’s just saying a university is supposed to be a place for open inquiry where free speech exists, and he gets run out of his position for this. Scanlan: Yep. And that’s something I also personally found because this has been documented, but I wrote an opinion piece for the school newspaper regarding this. It was polled within a few hours of it going out. And they told me and I finally got ahold of a kid on the staff, and he said that the entire staff was threatening to quit over the piece being there because they couldn’t stand for transphobia on their platform. I mean, it’s on my Twitter. You can read the... It had so many edits. There were words that were cut out of there, sentences that were “too harsh.” They jacked up the whole piece and it was still so offensive. I even let people I knew who were very left-leaning read it and tell me what they thought was offensive and they couldn’t even find anything. It was just the thought of having something that said, “I don’t think it’s fair for Lia to be swimming.” Roberts: By the way, I’m just going to pause for the sake of our audience. One of the things that we try to do regularly on the show, and I think it’s something you would appreciate, is we’ll get comments after an episode and people will say, “Kevin, would you please remember, A, to give us homework? What are the next steps? How can we help with this issue?” So we’ll come back to that before the end of our conversation. But B, this is the thing I’m thinking about, “How do we have conversations with people who tell us that we’re wrong, especially if they might be left of center politically?” And often the first thing that I say is, “Ask good questions.” And so I just want to point out, not that you need to hear this from me, but just for our audience, that’s an excellent example where you went to these people who were saying this, saying, “What is it about what I’m saying that you disagree with?” And when they say basically nothing, you know that they’re not operating in good faith. It’s probably a waste of time to be in a conversation with them. Move on to someone who might actually be movable on this issue, which I know is where you’ve sort of come to focus and we’ll get to that. But for the sake of the story, as a historian, I just have to move chronologically, it’s fall of 2021 and you’re confronted with this reality. So it’s gone from concept to this burden and now it’s a reality. What was that like to be a member of a swim team, a women’s team with a man on the team? Scanlan: So something people don’t realize is the Ivy League canceled all athletic competition from the 2020 to 2021 season. So we had a full gap year per se of no competition. And also we had no in-person classes. So in the weirdest way, that fall 2021 felt almost like it was my first day of school again, right? “Oh my gosh, I’m so excited. I get to be back in the classroom. I get to sit next to people in lecture, something I hadn’t done for three semesters. And oh my gosh, we get to swim again in a pool with my teammates instead of we were driving out to New Jersey in the fall of 2020 to go swim at a random club team that would host us.” So a lot of that excitement, I think in my mind, covered up the apprehension I might’ve felt for the situation that was pending. And I think very quickly I did snap out of it, but at the beginning I said, “It’s okay that I have to deal with this horrible situation because I’m just so excited to be back.” And I think a lot of people also probably felt the same way. Again, I can’t speak for everyone, but that was my experience. And then quickly I jumped back to reality when I realized, “Oh my gosh, we’re changing in the same locker room as a male.” And we never talked about this. And previously, someone had said that Lia would be changing an alternative locker room. We never really had a conversation about it, so I’m not sure why I would’ve assumed that would’ve been the case. But I think I did hold that hope for that. And obviously, that was not the reality. Lia had a locker in there just like everybody else. Roberts: That had to be astounding that it would be the expectation if you realize, “Okay, this is going to happen,” that there’s at least going to be a barrier, hopefully just a different room, for him to be able to change, and there wasn’t. And to fast-forward a little bit, once you decided to tell this story and it started getting more media attention, it was that reality that Americans who weren’t necessarily paying attention to this issue, that seemed to galvanize them to the position that you had, that is to say they had seen scenes, videos of him swimming. And as odd as that was, that’s sort of the depth of their thought, right? Pardon the pun. But they did not really think about the locker room situation. And for any human obviously, it’s obvious the problem there, but I think especially for people with children. Even if they’re far left of center, politically, they can see that this is a real issue. But your coach, the administration at Penn did nothing to correct us. This was just the matter of course for the remainder of your swimming career. Scanlan: Yeah. And to be fair to them, if you’re going to allow Lia to be on this team, why would they not have the same privilege as everyone- Roberts: It’s logically consistent I will say that. Scanlan: Right. So that’s something I had to point out to myself. I was like, “Okay, well, at least they’re being logical in some way, shape or form, even though the whole situation was obviously illogical.” But yeah, and the thing you mentioned about children brought up something. I actually didn’t even think about this. This is one of my teammates who is not publicly talking about this, but has spoken to me privately. So we went on training trip in December of 2021. We shared the same locker room as all the young kids who swim at this facility. So there were children as young as four and five that were changing in the same locker room that we were. My teammate told me that she at the beginning didn’t know how to feel about the whole situation. She knew in her heart it was wrong, but wasn’t as strong maybe as I felt at the time. And she told me that the visual of seeing Lia changing next to a four and five year old girls, roughly again, I didn’t ask them for their age, she just said she knew in that moment that her heart sank she told me. And she said that was the turning point for her. She said, “This is not acceptable and I don’t know what to do.” And she felt hopeless. I felt hopeless. We all did. And that to me is so scary. Those kids’ parents probably didn’t even know that we were training there. They had no idea. Roberts: There’s no way. Scanlan: No. Roberts: Because almost every parent, even if they were sympathetic to his situation politically or just socially, because America is a tolerant place, even when we disagree with people, had they known that, they know that that’s wrong, especially given the age difference. And I think that’s part of the problem, right? Which is in addition to the obvious issues, just the lack of transparency. Scanlan: Yeah. Actually, someone made a graphic on Twitter of a four-year-old or a young child changing next to Lia. I responded to it and got a lot of likes. So I said, “This situation actually did happen to some extent.” And people were like, “You’re lying about this” and accusing me of all this stuff. But it did happen. It is true. And that’s something I didn’t think about because we dealt with Lia in the locker room every day. And that’s something I expected because we knew Lia was going to be on the team, but I thought about all the girls who swam against us that we also shared locker rooms with. They didn’t know. And Riley’s talked about this. She had no idea. And I didn’t even think about, of course the other girls, the other NCAA teams didn’t think about the fact that we changed with Lia every day because it was just so unfathomable to even consider. Roberts: Well, and I want to ultimately get into that moment when you decide to start speaking in very vocal ways. But I’m curious about another aspect of this, of the unfairness, and this is from a brother of my younger sister, very serious athlete and dad of three daughters, the unfairness of men competing in women’s sports to begin with. Beyond the locker room situation, beyond the lack of transparency by your administration and unfortunately by your own coach, just the unfairness of that, for you as a very serious athlete as a woman, what sense do we make of that, if anything? Scanlan: Well, growing up, I swam with boys, and I always knew that they were always faster than me. Didn’t matter who they were, always faster. I think part of this situation, the reason why the Lia situation blew up so much bigger is that Lia’s times as Will, so will Thomas on the men’s side, had faster times in all the female world records in all those events, which is very drastic. Not every male who competes is going to be at that level. And for me, I was worried genuinely because I didn’t know how much you’d slow down if you take these hormones. And it’s still unclear at best. And I was very worried that if Lia showed up and swam the exact same times Will did, obviously that didn’t quite happen, they would break world records. And that really opened my eyes to how dramatic it could be. Obviously, every instance of a male competing is not that dramatic. But to be clear, I’ve trained with boys my entire life growing up. I trained with boys in college as well. They’re always faster. They always are. Roberts: You need to feel less of a human with this reality, I’m presuming. Scanlan: Yes. Even my dad who swam, he did a few open water races, he was not a D1 swimmer by any means, when I was 14. And so in training, my dad could still beat me, and he’s in his 60s now. He didn’t swim competitively to the level I did, obviously. And Riley said the same thing. Her husband was on the men’s team in terms of placement at NCAAs and things like that. Her husband is not better than her, but if they raced, Riley would lose. It’s just so clear. And the fact that I even have to defend this is just so funny to me. Roberts: It’s ridiculous we even have to have the conversation, right? Scanlan: Yep. Roberts: So, moving on to the public platform that you’ve established, thank goodness, and thanks again for doing that. And know that Heritage every step of the way will be your friend. You can handle yourself, but sometimes when you’re in the fight, it’s good to know that you got a lot of friends out there. When was the light bulb moment? When was it that you said, “Okay, I’ve talked to my family, my friends, I’ve complained about it, but I’m actually going to be very vocal about this on a national level?” Scanlan: A lot of things came into this. So after I graduated, I was doing anonymous interviews. I was in the What Is a Woman? documentary with the masked face, and people knew that it was me. If you screenshot the image of my face and turn your brightness up, you can see my side profile quite clearly. I just wanted some plausible deniability to just go on and live my life. My parents are very traditional type of family. We have dinner together every night. Roberts: Great practice. Scanlan: We went to church growing up, the things that aren’t so normal anymore. And obviously my parents wanted me to go to good school and get a good job. So I studied engineering in college, worked very hard. I got a job working as a product manager in New York City upon graduating, and I just said, “You know what? Forget all this stuff. I’m going to go live my life and I’m going to make money doing this job and I’m going to do the traditional thing,” which the traditional thing is going to college and getting a good job being successful. At least in my family it is. And I went on and in that year I was working, I couldn’t stop thinking about what happened. There were still nights where I would cry about my experiences. I think part of me also thought that some of my teammates that didn’t like my opinions would come back to me. I had friends that I lost on the team over this. None of them ever spoke to me again, even after I was quiet for the year upon graduating and work and then eventually coming forward. And I saw a lot of this stuff. And then I started working and I was placed on a team. So I really liked my job at the beginning. I was placed on a team that I didn’t like so much, and I had a hard time with it. And that really pushed me over the edge because I said, “Okay, the only reason I’m scared now is I’m going to lose my job. Well, I can find a new job if I want to.” Roberts: It’s America. Scanlan: Yeah, I’m not... And I wasn’t super tied to my position at the time. And so that ultimately, a mix of that and I just couldn’t stop thinking about what had happened, that mix eventually pushed me over to deciding to come forward. And a lot of it I did actually really turn to prayer a lot. I’ve been religious, but I’m not one of those people who goes to mass every single day. There are some days that I miss admittedly. But I really was in a lot of pain just torn between what to do, and I took a lot of it to prayer. And God and my life just took me to the point where I quite literally woke up one morning and I said, “I think it’s time. I think it’s time to speak about this. And if I only get to do it once, at least I know I put my heart out there.” Roberts: I really do mean this. What a moving summary of that moment. I want to pick up with that moment. But I also want to say, to pick up on another theme that comes up on this show organically probably because of the Holy Spirit, and that’s faith. And not that every guest here has to be so serious in their faith as you are. But the point is, I’m often asked when I give talks around the country, “Kevin, can you have conservatism? Can you have America without people of faith?” And I’ve become convinced the answer to that is no, that obviously it’s America. We’re a pluralistic society. There are many different ways to practice the faith, even for those of us who are both Roman Catholic. There might be different masses that we attend, but the point is, that seeking eternal truth, however we want to have that journey, is an essential part to not just the project of conservatism, but I would argue across the political spectrum, the project of America. And it’s not a surprise to me, having spent some of the afternoon with you today, that that’s an important part of that moment when you say, “Okay, I’m going to give up this job that presumably you had been working for,” right? I mean, you’re in college thinking, “This is your first steps of the American dream in order to go say something that I know from deep inside, from on high I’m inspired to do.” How’s it gone? Scanlan: I think it’s gone pretty well. Obviously, I’ve met with the people I expect to not support me and some challenges with that. But I think overall, knowing... The best way to explain it is a huge weight was lifted off my shoulder in a way because it’s not that I was ever secretive about my opinions, but it was just so many people said, “Oh, it’ll be so much more powerful if you speak about it with your voice behind it,” because anonymous interviews can only go so far. And a lot of it’s just really, yeah, huge weights lifted off my shoulder, that’s the best way to explain it. Just feeling more free and more open. And I think even at the beginning, a lot of the ways I talk about this have opened up even more where at the beginning I said, “I don’t really want to address the locker room situation at all because it made me uncomfortable.” And I knew some people claim that that’s the most transphobic part of the argument or whatever name-calling they use. And I hesitated from a lot of those conversations. I also really struggle with pronouns and how to address those people. I don’t want to be disrespectful. I’ve never wanted to be disrespectful. Roberts: That’s obvious sitting here with you, that’s not your mo. Scanlan: Yeah. But the thing I noticed is even when I was being the most respectful I could, I was still getting led with the hate I was trying to avoid. So a lot of it’s opened me up to now I talk more freely about these things. I don’t think too hard about it. And that’s been my journey only in the nine weeks or so I’ve even really been speaking about this. Roberts: We were talking off camera, joking mostly, although the charges that come in, especially on social media can be pretty serious .for people who are listening to this conversation, watching this conversation, or they’ve been following you, who might be inspired by your story, themselves to step up and whatever issue it may be, what advice would you give them on handling the naysayers? Because when we step up in this culture unfortunately, the naysayers are going to sound off. What’s been a good practice or practices you’ve used to handle that? Scanlan: Yeah. Well, I’m still dealing with it. And there are days where I definitely kind of sit there and I think to myself, “Maybe I should go back to my job. Maybe my life would be so much easier if I just never did this.’ And then quickly it’s thrown out and I say, “No, I know I’m doing this for the right reason.” I think it’s staying true to yourself and what you believe in. Something that society has taken so far is that standing firm in your beliefs is sometimes looked to be a bad thing. And that’s something I struggled with, I still struggle with. And I think just being firm in who you are and comfortable in who you are is the first step. If you know that you’re correct and you’re confident in who you are and you’re confident in your opinions, no matter what other people say, that’s not going to change that because you have confidence in yourself. And I think that’s the first step to getting used to all this stuff. And it never goes away. And again, there’s still days where I am hurt by some of the things that people say about me, but all I can do is be truthful. Roberts: Being truthful, keeping a good cadre of friends, finding new friends, and also remembering that there’s a purpose to this, right? So those are all great practices. Obviously, a lot of my colleagues at Heritage are confronted with this kind of thing. Even my colleagues at Heritage would say beyond whatever they get, most importantly, our friends who are grassroots leaders who are volunteering to do what they’re doing, they’re the people who are really making sacrifices. We have the privilege of, as we like to say, representing them here behind enemy lines in Washington, DC. But the other thing that’s really important, and this is absolutely true on this issue, is that there is not just a silent majority of Americans who agree with you. It’s an overwhelming majority of Americans who do, and they’re not going to spend a whole lot of time sounding off on Twitter or Instagram or whatever. So keep that in mind. You were in Texas in the last few days. Tell us about that. Scanlan: Yes, that was interesting. I’m not sure if you guys- Roberts: Now those are good words. Scanlan: So we were just there to have a ceremonial signing with Governor Abbott about this bill. So previously they had passed a bill to say, “You must compete in the category that your sex assigned at birth says,” right? Why are we even writing this into law, I don’t know. But he did. And he decided actually later, and this was what this was for, SB 15, expands this to public colleges in the state of Texas. And what that means is he’s basically telling the NCAA that, “If you want to sue us, that’s fine, but this is going to be our law in Texas.” And that was great win, huge win, super exciting day. But we were met with a riot of people outside. And I mentioned to you before we started that I was visiting my aunt and uncle. So my aunt and uncle came to pick me up, but because all the entrances were barricaded by these protestors, they couldn’t actually get in to find me for about an over an hour. So my aunt and uncle got the luxury of walking around and hanging out with all these protesters, and they were taking pictures. My uncle got a bunch of footage. He actually interviewed some people and asked them why they were even there. Some of them didn’t even know. So that was, to me, very interesting. And something Riley pointed out about the whole situation is that this was 2:00 PM on a Monday afternoon. Do those people not have jobs? And that was something- Roberts: Some of their jobs are maybe to protest, right? Scanlan: That’s what Riley also brought up to me and I laughed because I didn’t even think about that. But yeah, I like to think that that group is such a minority. But something of a shocking to me about that is I assumed Texas being a more conservative state would not have this level of protest. And also I assumed that on the sports issue, a lot of people agreed, because I understand the gender-affirming care is a little bit more controversial, but I really truly thought on the sports issue, even trans people agreed that I might not be fair, but I think I might’ve read it a little bit wrong and been a little bit too hopeful there. Roberts: I actually think you’re largely right based on the studies that I’ve seen. And that’s the effect of a couple hundred protestors I gather who were there, is that they want you to think that they want to discourage you from taking the next step. They want to create this visual on the evening news that the overwhelming percentage of Americans actually are on their side. When in fact, on this issue, we just know qualitatively it’s not true. But what I love about that Texas law, and I love about my friend Governor Abbott in doing this, is even though the NCAA has griped at him and the Texas legislature for doing this, he’s basically challenged them. And we know how this will turn out Texas and other states who do this, pass this kind of law, are going to prevail. So what’s next for Paula Scanlan? What’s on the horizon for you? Scanlan: Well, continuing to get laws passed like we did in Texas. So I’m working with the Independent Women’s Forum. Roberts: Great group. Scanlan: Yeah, love them. We’re doing appearances at places. We’re talking to policymakers. We’re trying to push... Unfortunately, with the current administration on a federal level, this is probably not going to get passed. But states work very well. We’ve been successful in Texas. We’ve done some stuff in Oklahoma, Tennessee. All right-leaning states. I do want to work on some of the left-leaning ones. I’m from Connecticut. I do hope to- Roberts: Good luck there, Paula. Scanlan: ... to make some push there. Roberts: Good. Scanlan: I mean, it’s not that hopeful, but I do have several allies in my area. Roberts: I think it’s possible, by the way. I know that it’s an uphill climb, but I do think it’s possible. We have to be active in all of these places, to your point. Scanlan: It’s true. And that’s something that I said, “Okay, great. We can focus on these conservative states and wonderful. Okay, a girl in Texas is protected, but what about, I grew up in Connecticut and I actually grew up swimming in New York because my team is in New York City, so I wouldn’t have been protected if this happened to me seven years ago when I was a high schooler?” So that’s something I want to work on. And I know it’s going to be really challenging, and I know it’s a lot of work. But unfortunately, we have to fight for everyone. We have to fight for all those girls who need sports in their life. It was really important for me in my life to have swimming. It helped balance me from my schoolwork in high school, helped balance my life. And if one girl is denied that opportunity, then we failed. Roberts: That’s very eloquent. I ask every guest basically the same question at the end, and I’ve really been looking forward to asking you this question because of your courage, your cheerfulness, which is very genuine and very obvious to anyone who’s in your presence, but because of your generation, which just according to the studies is the most pessimistic about the American future. It’s the first generation since Gallup’s been doing this study in the 1940s, starting in the ‘40s, that believes the American dream’s not possible for them. So if I take that data and then I take what you have been confronted with and transpose that onto your generation writ large, I would think that most of you have reason to be pessimistic about the future, but there’s something that tells me you might be a little more hopeful. So in spite of all of these things you’ve experienced and challenges facing America more broadly, why are you optimistic about the American future? Scanlan: I’m optimistic because people in my generation, I think, are starting to open up. I think a lot of those studies are based on we’re really a social media age where you see everybody else doing things and they seem perfect. And I think that kind of puts people into feeling bad about themselves. But I’ve opened up to not spending my time thinking so much about what other people have thought of me. Riley’s done the same. There’s so many other female athletes that are speaking out. There’s even more that are speaking out about other issues. So I am hopeful that we’re turning the tide and that we are the next generation, and this is important for us to step up. And I know there’s going to be more voices joining soon, and I’m very hopeful about hearing their perspectives and their voices. So that’s what makes me hopeful. I know that it’s not as many people as I would like, but I do have hope. Roberts: There’s a critical mass there in your generation. And on this issue, I think we’re going to win. And we’re going to win because of, and I mean this, people like you and Riley and those athletes who are going to be stepping up as a result of your witness. So on behalf of all of us at Heritage, Paula Scanlan, thanks for being a great American. Scanlan: Thank you so much. Roberts: You bet. I told you you would enjoy that interview. And obviously we will stay tuned and follow Paula’s great work. Very cheerful, courage, which I think is a great lesson. It’s a great model for all of us and the work that we do. I hope that you’re as inspired as I am and all of us at Heritage are by what she is doing. Until next time, keep the faith. We’re going to win.

{"title": "In the Military, Physical Fitness Outranks Gender “Equity”", "author": ["Thomas  Spoehr"], "date": "Aug 22, 2023 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/defense/commentary/the-military-physical-fitness-outranks-gender-equity", "takeaways": ["Section 557 of [the Senate version of the NDAA] would scrap the current Army Combat Fitness Test and replace it with the old Army Physical Fitness Test.", "The ACFT was developed both to increase overall fitness and to assess whether soldiers can meet the needs of certain demanding combat positions. ", "The proper path here is not to revert to the old test, but instead to establish gender-neutral standards for the Army’s physically demanding occupations."], "text": "Physical fitness is a cornerstone of military readiness. Historically, this quality has helped American servicemembers fight and win over numerically superior enemies. Nevertheless, Congress has rarely taken much interest in a service’s military physical fitness testing—until now. On Thursday night, the Senate approved its version of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). Section 557 of that bill would scrap the current Army Combat Fitness Test and replace it with the old Army Physical Fitness Test. Meanwhile, the House version of the NDAA proposes requiring a gender-neutral fitness test for combat arms positions. In both cases, the issue is to ensure that fitness standards are not compromised for reasons unrelated to war-fighting. On the battlefield, physical fitness can be the difference between life and death. For four decades, the Army’s fitness test consisted of two minutes of pushups, two minutes of sit-ups, and a two-mile run. But the inadequacies of this test proved glaring in Afghanistan and Iraq, where soldiers frequently suffered exoskeleton injuries as a result of their lack of holistic fitness. >>> Obesity Epidemic Threatens Not Just Public Health, but Also National Security This led the Army to attempt to find a test that would better evaluate fitness. After much research and testing, they finally did: the Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT). The ACFT is more comprehensive than the old test, encompassing 10 aspects of physical fitness. It evaluates muscular strength, endurance, power, speed, agility, coordination, flexibility, balance, reaction time, and aerobic capacity. The old test measured only two of these—muscular endurance and aerobic capacity. The ACFT’s criteria are also designed to simulate physical activities needed in combat—for example, dragging a wounded comrade (sled drag) or moving ammunition containers (kettlebell carry). The ACFT was developed both to increase overall fitness and to assess whether soldiers can meet the needs of certain demanding combat positions. The latter took on greater importance in January 2016, when then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter opened all military occupations and positions to women. Thus, the ACFT was designed to provide gender-neutral physical standards based on different military occupational specialties. Indeed, in 2021, Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville testified to Congress that he was committed to gender-neutral testing. In spite of this, the Army abruptly scrapped its plan for gender-neutral testing and lowered the minimum passing standards for the pushups and running. The change came after large percentages of female recruits were not passing the ACFT. When asked about this change, Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth responded that the Army did not want “unfair standards” for “a particular subgroup” that “couldn’t perform.” Concerned about the implications of this change on warfighting, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) subsequently introduced legislation in the FY 2023 NDAA requiring the Army to implement a gender- and age-neutral fitness standard for combat jobs by June 2023. The Army, however, took the position that it was already in compliance with the law and therefore “unlikely” to make additional changes to the test. This brings us to the current situation. The Senate provision requiring reversion to the old test has served as a “wake-up call” to the Army that the status quo is unacceptable. It has certainly gotten the Army’s attention. Meanwhile, the House version of the bill contains a requirement similar to the one originally established in the 2023 NDAA, where an “enhanced” gender-neutral standard would be created for combat roles only. The rest of the Army would still maintain the current ACFT requirements. >>> Biden’s Pentagon Can’t Recruit New Soldiers and That Threatens Us All Combat is unforgiving. A focus on achieving gender “equity” in combat formations, rather than attaining scientifically established fitness standards, will put the Army on the path to ruin. Senate frustration with the Army is understandable. The proper path here, however, is not to revert to the old test, but instead to establish gender-neutral standards for the Army’s physically demanding occupations, which should be determined by the actual requirements of the positions. For example, artillery soldiers are often required to handle shells that weigh more than 90 pounds. But this ability is not necessary for a computer specialist. Congress is playing an important role here. In the end, there must be a way to ensure that soldiers have the proper levels of fitness to perform their jobs, while at the same time, providing maximum opportunity for as many people to serve as possible. The Army Combat Fitness Test, with its six criteria, is a superior measure to the previous test and its three criteria. And gender-neutral tests with standards for combat occupations is necessary for all the services, not just for the Army. Encouragingly, in his recent confirmation hearing, the nominee to be the next Chief of Staff of the Army, Gen. Randy George, committed to just that. National defense is the most important priority for the federal government, and its fitness standards must reflect this. The 2024 National Defense Authorization Act should codify this requirement."},

If this ideology breaks apart the gender binary system, it breaks apart its own foundation.", "In the wake of the House Judiciary Committee hearing, careful observers should recognize that the house of gender indeed is built on sinking sand.  "], "text": "Light may be breaking through the darkness of gender ideology, as revealed by a recent hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on “due process violations and gender-affirming care.” During the hearing, Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., showed part of a video interview with Dr. Blair Peters, who performs transgender surgeries on minors and adults at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, Oregon. That interview proved just how experimental and unstudied “gender-affirming” medical care is. The video interview with Peters, conducted about a year ago, received too much unwanted attention after its release and later was privatized on YouTube. After the Judiciary Committee’s July 27 hearing, the entire video resurfaced on the social media app X, formerly Twitter. The interview with Peters exposes much more than the barbarism of “gender-affirming” surgery. It also proves that the house that gender ideology built is constructed on sinking sand. Peters, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon whose preferred pronouns are “he/they,” specializes in gender-reassignment surgery in the facial, chest, and genital areas. But, he says, genital surgery is “the majority of my practice and sort of where my passion lies.” A self-described “queer” surgeon, Peters says his goal is “helping you self-actualize how you see yourself internally.” In short, Peters says he reconstructs a patient’s genitals to “match” what the patient believes to be his or her true gender. A boy who believes he is a girl can obtain vaginoplasty. A girl who believes she is a boy can obtain phalloplasty. Peters’ reference to self-actualization in gender identity is purposeful. Self-actualization, after all, tops the late psychologist Abraham Maslow’s influential hierarchy of needs and is defined as the full realization of one’s creative, intellectual, and social potential. In other words, becoming all that one can be. To that end, gender ideology is self-actualization in its most brutal and misguided form. Peters’ surgical offerings prove it. For most of the interview, Peters speaks about “nonbinary” surgery options, an emerging concept within “gender-affirming” care. Such surgeries rearrange a patient’s genitals and/or chest tissue in a way that aligns with neither sex, supposedly to combat the so-called binary bias of male v. female in society. Gender-affirming surgeons, for example, may construct one aspect of female genitalia while omitting others, resulting in an unnatural combination of a male patient’s original body construction and his surgically fabricated one. Likewise, Frankensteinian surgical options exist for female patients. These options can remove the “binary bias” in health care, Peters argues. He says that he hopes such options will cure patients’ gender dysphoria while allowing them more fluidity. Although gender transitions initially were understood as a “switch” from one presentation of gender to another (from male to female, or vice versa), this binary gender system apparently has become too restrictive for some. These new surgeries, Peters claims, are “less about reinforcing this binary view of genitalia and anatomy, and more so [about] embracing the person’s own unique concept of themselves.” The desire for radical self-definition has led to a hatred of all forms of imposed categorization. Breaking down the understanding of one’s individual biology was only the first step; now gender ideology also must break down the reality of the gender binary itself. Fundamentally, gender identities such as “nonbinary” and “gender fluid” with their corresponding surgical “solutions” are new threats to reality. An article at Healthline.com claims that “the gender binary is the false idea that there are only two genders and that every single person is one of these two genders.” This argument attacks one of the most fundamental truths of human existence: Every single human person is either male or female. All human civilization has operated according to this principle from time immemorial. Yet now, this understanding is somehow controversial. Peters’ flavor of radical self-actualization indicates a preference for something—anything—other than males and females (or those that present that way). The problem? The binary itself is all that exists. Peters must account for the fact that the concept of gender identity is rooted in the gender “binary,” or the objective categories of man and woman. Originally a synonym for “sex,” the term “gender” evolved to include the performative and social aspects of one’s sex. John Money, one of the first to study the concept of gender, for example, defined it as “all those things that a person says or does to disclose himself or herself as having the status of boy or man, girl or woman, respectively.” The very definition of gender relies on the man/woman binary. One of the most influential LGBTQ advocacy groups, the Human Rights Campaign, defines gender identity as “one’s innermost concept of self as male, female, a blend of both or neither.” The word “neither” exposes the true emptiness of HRC’s definition. If one can identify as neither gender, what is one identifying as? Gender identity flows from gender. And gender flows from the man/woman binary, or sex. At its foundation, gender identity relies on the objective categories of sex. If this ideology breaks apart the gender binary system, it breaks apart its own foundation. Suddenly, the notion of “gender-affirming surgery” doesn’t work to “affirm” anything at all. But gender ideologues don’t really care for facts, reality, or science. And the gender-affirming medical field is ever-evolving to adapt to this nonsensical nonbinary ideology. All gender-affirming surgeries are riddled with risks and complications, as Peters openly admits. And the long-term effects of these new nonbinary surgeries are completely unknown. “No one’s published on it yet … we’re kind of learning and figuring out what works,” Peters says casually in the interview. Most disturbing in the gender debate is the age of the patients who are being experimented on. Although Peters says he tries to find out “what works” and eliminate “binary bias,” minor children subjected to these genital surgeries experience months—or even lifetimes—of painful recovery, sterility, incontinence, and more. In every other context, the ability of children to make certain choices is limited. They can’t enter into contracts, drink alcohol, or vote. They can’t be drafted, get a tattoo, or own property. Children don’t possess the same emotional and mental capacity of adults. All states have an age of majority law that separates adults from children and dictates when individuals are old enough, for example, to file a lawsuit or consent to general medical treatment. Permitting experimental surgeries that permanently mutilate the healthy bodies of children is simply inconsistent with such state laws. In the wake of the House Judiciary Committee hearing, careful observers should recognize that the house of gender indeed is built on sinking sand.

On Nov. 7, Ohioans will vote on the “Right to Make Reproductive Decisions Including Abortion” Initiative to amend the state’s constitution. The key word in the title of this proposal is “including,” because it is about much more than abortion. Its backers hope that the focus on abortion will distract voters from the other left-wing policy aims hidden in this Trojan horse. The Ohio Legislature has been responsible for abortion policy since the state was founded. In 2019, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed Ohio’s “Heartbeat Bill” into law, making abortion a crime after about six weeks of pregnancy, when a baby’s heartbeat can be detected. Abortion clinics have challenged this law under the state constitution, and the Ohio Supreme Court has agreed to consider the case. This is why abortion advocates want an explicit right to abortion added to the Ohio Constitution. The initiative would create a right to “make and carry out one’s own reproductive decisions,” which include abortion, contraception, fertility treatments, miscarriage care, and continuing a pregnancy. Here are just some of the initiative’s numerous problems. First, while the measure lists some “reproductive decisions,” it also adds the magic words “but not limited to.” In other words, no one on Election Day will know what the measure they will vote on really covers. And no one will ever really know. Just as the U.S. Supreme Court invented a right to abortion in Roe v. Wade, so the Ohio courts will continuously “amend” the Ohio Constitution by interpreting this open-ended phrase as they please. How far could they go? It is hardly a stretch to see that reproductive decisions involve reproductive organs. Bingo! The gender ideology door is now open for “reproductive decisions” to include permanently altering the body and its capability for reproduction. But, you might say, certainly this would apply only to adults who (presumably) can make informed decisions about such profound matters. You’d be wrong. This ballot measure refers only to the “individual,” erasing any distinction between males and females and between adults and minors. Children would have a constitutional right to make and carry out reproductive decisions. Equating children and adults in the constitution blocks the Legislature from enacting any laws to require parental involvement, either consent or mere notification, in decisions about the full range of reproductive and gender decisions. This radical concept goes far beyond anything the Supreme Court ever did. It repeatedly recognized what we all know: that minors “often lack the ability to make fully informed choices.” In Ohio, minors must have their parents’ consent to make many choices far less significant or life-changing than reproductive and gender decisions, such as getting a tattoo or receiving medical treatment. This measure would not only directly shut parents out of this category of decisions, but its broader impact on parental rights will not be known until the courts—in cases brought by zealous ideologues—tell Ohioans what that impact will be. Not only does this measure isolate children from parents, it also legally insulates anyone who “assists” isolated minors in making and carrying out reproductive decisions. Teachers, friends, predators, or anyone else could pressure children into taking these life-altering steps while parents would be left dealing with the aftermath of decisions they did not even know had been made. But there’s more to this right to carry out reproductive decisions. The Supreme Court has consistently held that a woman’s “right” to have an abortion does not require that taxpayers subsidize the procedure. If this measure passes in November, however, the Ohio Constitution will guarantee a right to both make and carry out reproductive decisions. Therefore, lawsuits asking courts to require Ohioans to foot the bill for abortion, contraception, and all the rest are certain. And while the proposal mentions “fetal viability” as the point at which abortion may be restricted, it defines that term more narrowly than the Supreme Court ever did under Roe v. Wade. In 1973, the court defined it as the “point at which the fetus [is] potentially able to live outside the mother’s womb.” The Ohio ballot measure, on the other hand, defines it as “the point in a pregnancy when … the fetus has a significant likelihood of survival outside the uterus.” The Ohio initiative would move the definition of “viability” later in the pregnancy, allowing an abortion ban only after babies have a “significant likelihood of survival.” And even then, this likelihood is determined solely by the abortionist and can still be trumped by “the pregnant patient’s … health,” which includes whatever the abortionist says it does, including mental health. Earlier this month, Ohio voters rejected a proposal to require 60% of the popular vote, rather than a simple majority, for amending the state constitution. The immediate focus of the proposal was on the November reproductive decisions ballot measure, but the proposal might have also limited the ill-conceived and broader trend of using the constitution, rather than the legislative process, to make policy decisions. Legislation—and not a constitutional amendment—is the best vehicle for controversial policies on divisive issues. Constitutions govern government, whereas legislation governs people, and ordinary citizens get to participate in the debate and discussion of legislation through their elected representatives. In the end, it’s clear that there is a lot more on Ohio’s November ballot than meets the eye. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

Is Supreme Court Next Stop?", "author": ["Sarah Parshall Perry"], "date": "Aug 30, 2023 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/more-courts-uphold-bans-gender-affirming-care-minors-supreme-court-next-stop", "takeaways": ["As the 6th Circuit did in its decision upholding the Tennessee law, the 11th Circuit wasted no time in both overturning the lower court decision.", "While the lower court had applied the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision...to equate “gender nonconformity” with “sex,” the appellate court disagreed.", "The battle to protect the minds and bodies of adolescent children seems ultimately destined for the Supreme Court."], "text": "Activist judges who believe the propaganda on “lifesaving” “gender-affirming” care for minors are weeping into their lattes this month as a second federal appellate court has just upheld a duly enacted state law banning these practices for children. A few short weeks after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit upheld Tennessee’s law banning “gender-affirming” care for minors in the state, the 11th Circuit followed suit and upheld Alabama’s law prohibiting the same. In an opinion for the unanimous three-judge panel written by Judge Barbara Lagoa, the court overturned a lower court order that had enjoined a portion of Alabama’s Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act. The act makes it a felony, punishable to up to 10 years in prison, to administer “gender-affirming care” to minors—including chemical castration and radically transformative body modification procedures. The state’s appeal from the lower court’s decision halting the law centered specifically on section 4(a)(1)-(3), the portion of the law banning the administration of puberty blockers or “cross-sex hormones.” But as the 6th Circuit did in its decision upholding the Tennessee law, the 11th Circuit wasted no time in both overturning the lower court decision and going so far as to hold that the lower court had abused its discretion in applying the wrong standard of judicial review. Lagoa wrote, “The plaintiffs have not presented any authority that support the existence of a constitutional right to ‘treat [one’s] children with transitioning medications subject to medically accepted standards.’ Nor have they shown that [the law] classifies on the basis of sex or any other protected characteristic. Accordingly, section 4(a)(1)-(3) is subject only to rational basis review.” There are three standards for judicial review when a court must determine the constitutionality of a particular law: the rational basis test, the intermediate scrutiny test, and the strict scrutiny test. The intermediate and strict scrutiny tests are more restrictive standards of review than rational basis, and more difficult for a state to satisfy. Rational basis, however, is used when no fundamental right (such as free speech, voting, or religion) or suspect classification (such as race or national origin) is at issue. Under this standard, the state must simply show that the law is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest. This standard, the 11th Circuit held, was easily satisfied by the state of Alabama, and the state’s regulation of the use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormone treatments for minors was to be afforded a “strong presumption of validity.” The court continued with a discussion of whether the right to treat one’s children with puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones could be found within the more general 14th Amendment right to direct the upbringing of one’s children—as plaintiffs had claimed. The court found it did not. Citing the Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision of last June, the court noted that in order to determine whether a claimed right is one of the “substantive rights” guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, “Courts must look to whether the right is ‘deeply rooted in [our] history and tradition’ and ‘essential to our Nation’s scheme of ordered liberty.’” But, it continued, “the use of these medications in general—let alone for children—almost certainly is not ‘deeply rooted’ in our nation’s history and tradition.” Because the judges were being asked to break new ground in the field of substantive due process under the 14th Amendment, the court wrote that it was bound to exercise the “utmost care.” This, Lagoa wrote, the lower court had not done. In fact, she pointed out that the lower court had “grounded its ruling in an unprecedented interpretation of parents’ fundamental right to make decisions concerning the ‘upbringing’ and ‘care, custody, and control’ of one’s children,” and then applied the wrong judicial review standard of this new “right,” to boot. As far as the plaintiffs’ argument that the Alabama law was subject to intermediate scrutiny because it made sex-based classifications (relative to “gender nonconformity”), the court was unconvinced. While the lower court had applied the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision, Bostock v. Clayton County, to equate “gender nonconformity” with “sex,” the appellate court disagreed, noting that the Alabama law treated both sexes equally. Because it “classifie[d] on the bases of age and procedure, not sex or gender nonconformity, [it was] therefore not subject to any heightened scrutiny.” The court also slapped down the lower court’s application of Bostock—a case with a limited holding, and one that solely concerned the prohibition against sex discrimination in employment found in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Lagoa wrote, “The Equal Protection Clause contains none of the text that the Court interpreted in Bostock. It provides simply that ‘[n]o State shall … deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.’” She added, “Because Bostock therefore concerned a different law (with materially different language) and a different factual context, it bears minimal relevance to the instant case.” Within a few short days of the 11th Circuit’s decision, a Missouri state court upheld that state’s own SAFE (Save Adolescents from Experimentation) Act—the first trial court victory to date in cases interpreting laws that ban the mutilation of children in the name of “gender-affirming” care. In declining the plaintiffs’ request to halt the law, Judge Stephen R. Ohmer ruled, “The science and medical evidence is conflicting and unclear” and that “the evidence raises more questions than answers.” Nearly simultaneously, however, a Texas state court halted the operation of that state’s “transgender” medical procedures ban. The state immediately filed an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court, which temporarily halts the trial court’s ruling. The Texas attorney general’s office responded to the trial court’s decision by saying that it would “continue to enforce the laws duly enacted by the Texas Legislature and uphold the values of the people of Texas.” Still pending before a federal trial court in Florida is a challenge to that state’s “gender-affirming” medicine ban for minors as adopted by the Florida boards of Medicine and Osteopathic Medicine. That case should now be relatively easy to decide since that ban is nearly identical to the Alabama law that the 11th Circuit just upheld. In a previous case, Adams v. St. Johns County School Board, the 11th Circuit determined (again in an opinion written by Lagoa) that a school’s sex-segregated bathroom policy was not a violation of the Constitution because, just as the Alabama law does, it treated all students equally, regardless of sex. This is good news for the state of Florida as officials chart a path forward in defending their “gender-affirming” medical ban. With 22 states having enacted restrictions on “transgender” medical interventions for minors, and with courts in different states and different federal circuits reaching different conclusions in terms of upholding or overturning such laws, the battle to protect the minds and bodies of adolescent children seems ultimately destined for the Supreme Court.

That is until last week, when the Office of the Secretary of Defense returned the draft citation for the end-of-tour award for none other than the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, four-star Army Gen. Mark Milley. Because of Change 5, Milley’s citation must use the pronoun “themself” instead of “him.” Page 49 of the revised manual includes draft language for awards, such as this (emphasis added): The revised rules, found in Department of Defense Manual 1348.33, Volume 4, will apply to the most prestigious joint awards given by the Department of Defense, including the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal, the Joint Service Commendation Medal, the Joint Service Achievement Medal, and the Joint Meritorious Unit Award. Aside from the fact that the use of the pronoun “themself” is grammatically incorrect and just plain stupid sounding, it is insulting to every service man and service women in the armed forces. There are two sexes: male and female. When a member of the U.S. armed forces earns a military decoration or award, he or she deserves to be recognized in that member’s official citation by the pronoun “he” or “she,” not some woke, grammatically incorrect pronoun demanded by elitist Biden administration apparatchiks. Gender-neutral language used in cases where the actual, biological gender of the person is clearly known reduces that person to an androgenous non-entity, devoid—stripped, rather—of a profoundly fundamental characteristic central to who that person is as an individual. It effectively converts a distinguished service member into a sexless drone among a greater collective of genderless “servicepersons.” Through the use of a mere four words—“incorporates gender neutral language”—Change 5 imposes by fiat a radical redefining of what it means to be a man or a woman and to be recognized as such. It is the latest manifestation of a political agenda that seeks to homogenize humanity by stripping it of a defining characteristic. In essence, this is what the alphabet soup of gender identities and sexual orientations really amounts to: a watering down or dilution of identity to the point where the multitude of identities effectively means there is no defining identity—no actual “person” who can be known as a man or a woman, the essence of biological identity among humans. George Orwell would have included such a phrase—“gender neutral language”—in his dictionary of Newspeak terms had his world in 1949 been so gender-confused and immersed in the identity-politics of the Progressive Left. But this is a favorite tactic of those in power, to leverage the power of the executive branch to impose an administration’s writ through directives, executive orders, and even administration instructions. In this single case, four words dictate to the more than 2 million Americans proudly and honorably serving in uniform that their service to country—in any state, territory, or overseas assignment—in any joint capacity can only be recognized with the neutering word “themself.” Since the Biden administration imposed this diktat at the Joint-level, you can be sure this will trickle down into the service-level awards made by the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, and Space Force in fairly short order. Big Brother would be so pleased. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

To make up for its lost abortion revenue, it’s expanding its reach into what it calls “transgender hormone therapy.” The recent spike in these services is telling. According to their most recent annual reports, most of the nearly 600 Planned Parenthood centers now dispense cross-sex hormones. In 2016, only 32 Planned Parenthood clinics provided similar services. A 2022 Heritage Foundation analysis found that between one-third and one-half of the centers had entered the gender-bending market. One year later, Planned Parenthood’s newest reports reveal that what it calls “gender-affirming care” increased by 49%. (The Daily Signal is the news outlet of The Heritage Foundation.) Some regions outpaced others. For example, Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio boasts a 544% increase in “transgender services” visits from 2021 to 2022. Gender ideologues argue this spike in people “identifying” as transgender, nonbinary, and so forth simply reflects a more accepting American culture. But if growing acceptance drives this growth, then liberal areas of the country would, in theory, see a smaller increase in patient visits in the past year compared with conservative areas. After all, the ever-expanding “Pride” phenomenon started much earlier in dark-blue enclaves, such as Portland, Oregon, and New York City. That’s not what the data shows, however. Columbia-Willamette, a Planned Parenthood affiliate covering the greater Portland area, nearly quadrupled its “gender-affirming care” visits from 2021 to 2022. So, what caused this 3,063-visit increase? “Increased acceptance” is surely not the answer. Recent studies have sought to identify the root causes of distress over one’s sex, officially called gender dysphoria. Parent-child conflict, peer influence, social media, and a history of mental health issues might all play a role. We don’t have all the answers right now. But this uncertainty is surely a good reason to proceed with caution, rather than to dive headlong into these experimental medical interventions. With more people getting gender interventions at Planned Parenthood and elsewhere, what is the evidence for long-term benefits? Some patients report short-term relief, post-transition. But there is no evidence that those treatments are better than therapeutic solutions. On the contrary, there’s a growing consensus that irreversible treatments do serious harm to those suffering from gender dysphoria. The side effects of the cross-sex hormones, some of which are also used to chemically castrate pedophiles, are severe. They include infertility, stunted growth, and an increased risk of depression, blood clots, and cancer. Research by Heritage’s Jay Greene comparing states that do and do not allow minors to receive hormone therapy without parental consent is sobering. He found that easy access to these drugs was associated with a higher risk of suicide. This finding contradicts the claim that medical treatments for gender dysphoria are “lifesaving.” So, how are other countries responding to the irreversible nature of “gender-affirming” hormone therapy and the abysmal post-treatment results for patients? Traditionally liberal Western European nations, such as the U.K., Sweden, and Finland, are now much more restrictive. Norway’s health authorities are also now moving in the same direction. These decisions, backed by systematic reviews, found no evidence that the benefits of medical treatment for gender dysphoria outweigh the risks. The United States is now an outlier among Western peers in pushing affirmation alone. With mass uncertainty around both the causes and proper treatment for gender dysphoria, the U.S. should hit the metaphorical pause button on expanding life-altering gender-transition services, not double down on them. In the past couple of years, many conservative states have moved to protect minors from harmful medical interventions, and more should follow. But the federal government should do its part by eliminating federal funding for gender-altering drugs and surgeries. Thankfully, some policymakers are stepping up to the plate. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, proposed a bill that would prevent children’s hospitals from receiving  federal tax dollars if they provided gender hormone or surgical procedures to minors in the past year. House Republicans’ 2024 spending bill for the departments of Labor and Health and Human Services says Medicare and Tricare can’t cover gender-transition services. The Hyde Amendment has for decades kept the federal government from funding abortions. The law should also shield the American taxpayer from supporting gender treatments that have—at best—unknown long-term results on kids. Congress should defund Planned Parenthood’s latest “gender-affirming” boondoggle and instead fund real health care that doesn’t hurt women and girls, unborn children, and kids struggling with gender dysphoria.

"], "text": "Two politicians from Mexico traveled last week to Washington, D.C., to share chilling stories of how their left-wing government is punishing them for speaking out against gender ideology. The politicians, Rodrigo Iván Cortés and Gabriel Quadri, criticized Mexico’s ruling party, the Movement for Social Regeneration (or Morena), which runs a government with a totalitarian streak. Salma Luévano, a Morena representative in Mexico’s Congress, identifies as a “trans woman.” Luévano has hurled charges of “gender-based political violence” against Quadri, one of the two visiting politicians who spoke during a private event in Washington held by the legal organization Alliance Defending Freedom International. What “violence” had Quadri committed? He had tweeted about the unfairness of men who say they identify as women taking places from actual women in sports and politics. Mexican law requires that women hold 50% of the seats in Congress; it counts Luévano and another “trans woman,” María Clemente García, as part of the female quota. Never mind that the two lawmakers are men—which is what Quadri objected to. An election tribunal determined that Quadri had committed psychological, sexual, and digital violence against women. As punishment, he had to delete the offensive tweets, post court-drafted public apologies twice per day for 15 days, and complete courses on gender-based and transgender violence. Quadri also had to register as a “gender-based political violator.” This last condition may prevent him from running again for office. Another Critic Silenced In charge since 2018, the Morena party demands that Mexican politicians and clergy alike support its socialist agenda. And it silences those who voice objections. At the center of conflict again as a “trans woman,” Luévano has proposed legislation to amend Mexico’s Law on Religious Associations and Public Worship. The measure would punish churches whose traditional teachings on sexuality contradict the new gender ideology. Luévano himself has no qualms about acting offensively. The transgender lawmaker appeared in Mexico’s Congress to present his proposal while costumed as a Catholic pope. Cortés, then a member of Congress and last week a visitor to Washington, criticized the proposal as violating religious freedom. Worse, he referred to Luévano as “a man who self-ascribes as a woman.” Like Quadri, his former colleague, Cortés also has been convicted of committing “political violence.” Cortés lost his final appeal Wednesday when the Superior Chamber upheld the lower court’s verdict and found him guilty of political, digital, symbolic, psychological, and sexual violence. Politicians aren’t the only ones censored by the Mexican regime. The government also has muzzled Cardinal Archbishop Carlos Aguiar Retes of Mexico City and Cardinal Juan Sandoval Íñiguez of Guadalajara. Both cardinals were convicted of violating the nation’s Constitution when they told their Catholic flocks that the Morena party’s values are contrary to their faith. Two other bishops and a prominent priest were convicted on similar charges. Censorship Grows Elsewhere Of course, Mexico isn’t the only country where the Left’s embrace of gender ideology has led to censorship. Erika Nieto, a Colombian YouTube star, posted a video discussing her belief that marriage is a union of one man and one woman. A Colombian court forced Nieto to remove the video after an activist complained. The Constitutional Court of Colombia reversed the lower court’s ruling, but not without a fight. In England, the Rev. Bernard Randall lost his post as a school chaplain after he questioned the tenets of gender ideology in a sermon. Someone reported Randall to British anti-terrorist authorities. He sued the Church of England school over his dismissal, but lost in court. And then there’s the high-profile case of Päivi Räsänen. She is the Finnish politician who faced criminal charges for social media posts she made in support of Biblical teachings on marriage and sexuality. Räsänen was acquitted of all charges against her in 2022, but the prosecution appealed.  She will return to court to defend her rights again later this month. Meanwhile, a bill in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, Canada, would empower the attorney general there to create “2SLGBTQI+ community safety zones.” There, “acts of intimidation” and distributing “hate propaganda” would be punishable by a fine of up to $25,000. What qualifies? Is praying an act of intimidation in Canada? Is the Bible a kind of hate propaganda? Maybe so. Our northern neighbor’s Supreme Court just handed down a decision in a case, Hansman v. Neufeld, which involved a defamation lawsuit and accusations of hate speech. A school board trustee, Barry Neufeld, objected to the sexual orientation and gender identity curriculum in use in British Columbia schools. Neufeld was accused of having “bigoted” and “transphobic” views. In its ruling against Neufeld, the court stated that “the transgender community is undeniably a marginalized group in Canadian society.” U.N.’s Internal Struggles These cases illustrate what critics of gender ideology have argued for years: It is, at bottom, totalitarian. The disciples of this ideology seek to silence critics through state censorship for some and self-censorship for most. Under the banner of prohibiting “hate speech,” these legal and political tactics are the West’s new blasphemy laws. A century ago, Christian countries banned blasphemous speech against the church. Many Muslim countries still prohibit speech that disparages Muhammad. Now, gender ideologues likewise seek to impose their orthodoxy through legal and political pressure. A ban on “hate speech” is a favorite weapon in their censorship arsenal. Bodies within the United Nations system are wrestling with this conflict between gender ideology and freedom of speech. The U.N. Security Council and the U.N. Human Rights Council each passed resolutions this summer targeting “hate speech.” The Human Rights Council adopted a resolution on “Countering religious hatred constituting incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence” in reaction to Quran burnings in Sweden and Denmark. This resolution, promoted by Muslim countries, is intended to protect Islam from criticism or offense. Some Western countries opposed the measure in the name of free speech, but still support censorship when it offends the new orthodoxies of gender ideology. They failed to note the irony. The Security Council resolution “urges” governments to “publicly condemn” speech that is “motivated by discrimination including on the grounds of race, ethnicity, gender, religion or language.” It gives a nod to freedom of expression with its admonition to do so “in a manner consistent with applicable international law.” But the resolution also “urges” U.N. member states to “instill the principles of tolerance and respect” and “prevent the spread of intolerant ideology.” Upholding Fundamental Rights So, which intolerant ideologies will be on the receiving end of such measures? Gender ideology doesn’t peacefully coexist with other beliefs. And the U.N.’s track record on these conflicts is not good. The United States is unique in its strong First Amendment protections for speech and religious belief. But these are fundamental rights that apply to everyone, no matter where they live. The desire not to be offended, in contrast, doesn’t carry the same weight. The right way to combat hateful speech, or bad ideas, is with more speech and good ideas. Laws against vaguely defined hate speech—whether employed to protect the feelings of Muslims or sexual minorities or anyone else—are a bad idea. That’s true both at home or abroad.

", "Leftist education officials seem to want orderly board meetings and transparency policies—until these things give them less control."], "text": "School is not even back in session yet, but some state education officials are still trying to restrict parents’ influence over their children. At a school board meeting Thursday in Chino Valley, California, about 35 miles from downtown Los Angeles, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond tried to stop the board from considering a policy that would improve communication between educators and families. According to board Chairwoman Sonja Shaw, Thurmond shouted from his seat during the meeting, before he was recognized to speak during the public comment period. Shaw said in an interview that Thurmond would get his chance to address the board, but he was trying to intimidate members before he even reached the podium. “This is not your meeting. You don’t get to come and dictate how a meeting is run,” Shaw said of Thurmond’s actions. Thurmond rose in opposition to a board proposal that said if a student chooses to assume a “gender” at school that contrasts with his or her sex, school officials should notify families. Thurmond said LGTBQ+ students struggle with suicidal thoughts, but his time expired before he could explain what that means for the board’s policy. Thurmond left the podium, but almost immediately returned, this time refusing to leave. Shaw called for a recess as audience members began to shout, and video of the meeting shows security approaching Thurmond to lead him away. In a show of support for parents and children, the board approved the policy on a 4-1 vote. Thurmond’s behavior was notable because left-of-center policymakers have accused parents of acting unruly at school board meetings in recent years. President Joe Biden’s attorney general, Merrick Garland, even issued a memo two years ago warning federal officials to be on the lookout for aggressive parents at such meetings. Garland did not include advice for board members when the state’s highest education official ignores Robert’s Rules of Order. Thurmond was correct in saying that children who are confused about their sex often struggle with anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. But research has found that when individuals continue the so-called transgender process and undergo surgery to alter their sexual organs, such procedures do not improve the patient’s mental state. Researchers have replicated these findings across several studies. Students wrestling with the changes that come during puberty and other growing pains need compassion and thoughtful counseling. They need adults to help them cope with the underlying issues causing them distress. But radical gender advocates push children to consider medical interventions—and ultimately surgery—that result in irreversible changes. The Chino Valley board’s policy is crucial, then, because it includes parents in their child’s health-related behavior and decisions at school. The board’s policy is similar to The Heritage Foundation’s model “Given Name Act,” which says educators cannot address a child by a name or pronoun that does not align with information on a child’s birth certificate without parent consent. Policymakers in six states have adopted similar provisions, including officials in Arkansas and Virginia. (The Daily Signal is the news outlet of The Heritage Foundation.) Heritage’s proposal does not discriminate against children who attempt to assume a certain “gender” at school. It only requires that parents are informed. California law says that school personnel may withhold information from parents concerning a child’s “gender,” and Thurmond told media after the Chino Valley board meeting that he intends to challenge the board’s decision. But Shaw said legal counsel reviewed the board’s policy and found that it does not conflict with state statutes. “If teachers really believe a student is not safe at home, they have an obligation, as mandated reporters, to notify the authorities,” Shaw said in a statement. The board’s new policy “does not change that requirement.” California state policy misinterprets federal laws concerning family and student privacy and drives a wedge between children and parents. “That shows how much control they want over our children,” Shaw says. “This is not a party issue. This is a parent issue.” Leftist education officials seem to want orderly board meetings and transparency policies—until these things give them less control.

According to Education Week, families in six states have filed lawsuits against district schools when officials abide by policies stating that parents do not have to be informed when a child arrives at school and wants to “assume” a different “gender,” a slippery concept that eludes an agreed-upon definition. Families in Wisconsin, Virginia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine have challenged policies that allow school personnel to socially affirm young children who are confused about their sex and, in some cases, leave parents out of the discussion. None of the suits have been successful yet—one reason state lawmakers should move quickly to reaffirm parents as their child’s primary caregivers. >>> The Uprising: Families Clash With Schools Over LGBTQ Propaganda Some state officials are helping by considering what is known as the “Given Name Act,” a policy proposal that says K-12 educators must address a child by the name and pronouns that correspond with his or her birth certificate unless teachers receive express permission from parents. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders recently signed such a proposal, and lawmakers in Florida, North Dakota, Kentucky and Utah have adopted similar policies. By requiring educators to abide by parent’s wishes, policymakers include families in vital discussions concerning their minor-aged children. In a recent debate with an associate professor from Colorado, my opponent claimed that policies restricting the teaching about “gender,” policies that often also call for withholding information from parents about their child, we “deny [transgender individuals’] presence” and thereby “deny their humanity.” Yet telling a child’s parents that he or she is struggling in school with emotional or mental health issues is not denying the presence of anyone. Requiring this communication between teachers and families is, in fact, recognizing very serious issues. Research released earlier this year on individuals who were confused about their sex and assumed a “transgender” lifestyle found that these individuals were three to six times more likely to also have been diagnosed as autistic. The mainstream media, including the New York Times, is admitting that a significant number of young people who go to a gender clinic to seek medical interventions such as hormone therapies and puberty blockers are also struggling with anxiety, depression, eating disorders or attention-deficit disorders. Young people need help with these diagnoses—and adults need to recognize that treating mental health issues may help far more than a social affirmation of a young person’s confusion about his or her sex. Notably, research cited by former President Barack Obama’s administration finds that when people undergo sexual reassignment surgery, these procedures do not improve their mental health struggles. Some patients actually had more anxiety after surgery. >>> Governor Hobbs Puts Radical Ideology Before Kids’ Safety Focusing on a child’s mental health, then, and practicing watchful waiting as young people forge their way through puberty, is doing more to recognize a child’s humanity than any attempt at “gender affirmation.” In some instances, some school officials are going to great lengths to spread radical ideas about so-called gender. A Pennsylvania school recently paid more than $1,000 for elementary and high school teachers to receive gender training from the Gender and Sexuality Development Program at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. School officials then affirmed a kindergarten student’s attempt to assume a different gender, “exactly the sort of gender radicalism that deserves to be investigated by lawmakers,” according to Do No Harm, an advocacy and litigation organization that raises awareness about the harm to patients of all ages from radical racial or gender ideas when applied to medicine. When school officials hide information about children from their parents, this interferes with crucial family functions. As families take the issue to court, lawmakers should find ways to support them."},

", "The courts in Maryland have failed to secure the most basic rights of parents. ", "Parents must be restored at the center of intimate questions regarding their children’s mental and physical health."], "text": "If Maryland parents and lawmakers don’t act now, special-interest groups and radical gender activists will get what they want—namely, parents being removed from decision-making about their children’s education and well-being. In the past two years, Maryland’s largest public school district, Montgomery County, saw a purported 582% increase in students self-reporting as identifying as “gender nonconforming” or as a gender different from their biological sex. Some 239 students self-reported their “nonconforming gender identity” in the 2021-2022 school year, compared with just 35 students in the 2019-2020 school year. The parents of these children were supposedly not notified regarding the change in their children’s identity. What’s worst of all, however, is that some in the district’s administration seem to be thrilled about the rise in gender confusion among children. Public schools in Montgomery County are becoming LGBTQ+ indoctrination facilities. Guidance counselors are building “gender support plans” for students. According to district guidelines, they aren’t required to disclose a child’s preferred sexual identity to the parent and are instructed to strictly enforce transgender pronoun usage. Families have tried fighting back against this radical ideology. In 2020, three parents filed a lawsuit against the Montgomery County Board of Education over its gender-affirming guidelines, saying they were “expressly designed to circumvent parental involvement in a pivotal decision affecting” their children’s “care, health education, and future.” To the complainants’ dismay, a federal district court judge concluded that there was no “fundamental right [for parents to be promptly informed of their child’s gender identity] under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.” The courts in Maryland have failed to secure the most basic rights of parents. What’s worse is that the non-transparent gender policy is embedded into the guidelines of the Maryland State Department of Education. Its policies state that “no provision of state or federal law requires schools to affirmatively disclose [gender] sensitive information to parents.” Research by The Heritage Foundation outlines what provisions would make a parental bill of rights effective, yet lawmakers have failed to address the issue. Maryland parents must look to states such as Florida, a champion of school transparency, as to how best to protect and reaffirm their parental rights in education. In March, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the Parental Rights in Education Act into law. The bill “prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity” in kindergarten through third grade, bans teaching that isn’t “age-appropriate,” and enforces a requirement to “notify parents of any change in services from the school regarding a child’s mental, emotional, or physical health, or well-being.” In other words, it ensures normalcy for children, removes harmful instruction from the classroom, and gives parents full knowledge of their child’s health and education. When Maryland legislators return to the next General Assembly session in January, it’s critical that they adopt a parental bill of rights that contains provisions that will reaffirm parents as children’s primary caregivers, protect children from racial discrimination in the form of critical race theory, allow parents—and taxpayers—to view the material that educators are teaching students, and require that schools receive permission from parents before administering health services to students. Put another way, parents must be restored at the center of intimate questions regarding their children’s mental and physical health. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

Should girls on overnight school trips be forced to share sleeping arrangements with males? Should schools be addressing children by names that are not theirs, and using pronouns that differ from their sex, without their parents’ knowledge or consent? To all these questions, Arizona’s legislature answered a resounding no, only to have Governor Katie Hobbs respond with a vehement yes. Earlier this month, Hobbs vetoed bills (S.B. 1001 and S.B. 1040) that would have protected female-only spaces in schools and required schools to get parents’ permission before addressing children experiencing gender dysphoria by different names or pronouns. In her veto messages, Hobbs called these commonsense measures “harmful legislation directed at transgender youth,” adding, “I will veto every bill that aims to attack and harm children.” But Hobbs has it exactly backwards. The legislation she vetoed would have protected children. It’s her policies that put them in harm’s way. >>> What Is Gender Ideology? Children suffering from gender dysphoria—a feeling of discordance with one’s sexed body—deserve the same protections and dignity as everyone else. But ensuring their safety does not require eliminating female-only spaces or keeping secrets from parents about their children’s mental and emotional health — polices that are much more common than most parents realize. According to the most recent figures from Parents Defending Education, at least 17,000 public schools nationwide serving more than 10 million students have policies that “openly state that district personnel can or should keep a student’s transgender status hidden from parents.” Some of Arizona’s largest school districts, including Tucson Unified School District and Mesa Public Schools, have policies that by default keep parents in the dark if their children are struggling with gender-identity issues unless the child directs the school to inform the parents. Why are schools doing this? Activists claim that children suffering from gender dysphoria should be “treated” by altering their surroundings and their bodies to conform to their “internal sense of gender.” The process usually begins with “social transition” (such as changing names, pronouns, and dress) and is often followed by medical interventions, such as puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and eventually surgery to remove breasts or fundamentally alter their genitalia. In the activists’ view, parents who oppose or have concerns about such transitioning would put their children’s mental and emotional health at risk. But there is no good evidence that social transition is beneficial. A new study from the United Kingdom finds that, relative to the control group, children who suffer from gender dysphoria experience no positive impact on their mental health from socially transitioning. Indeed, social transition can be harmful. Before it became common to push medical transitions for minors, most cases of youth gender dysphoria resolved after these minors passed through puberty. This is why a growing number of medical professionals advise “watchful waiting.” That approach allows parents and doctors to observe whether the experience of puberty leads to the resolution of any gender confusion. But socially transitioning children, especially before puberty, can put them on a path to a life-altering drugs, irreversible surgeries, sterilization, and a lifetime of complex medical interventions. As Max Eden of the American Enterprise Institute has explained, “Evidence suggests that treating children as if they are the opposite sex can cause their feelings of gender dysphoria to persist and increase the likelihood that they will seek experimental hormonal intervention.”"},

The problem is the ideology itself."], "text": "Victor Madrigal-Borloz, the United Nations’ independent “expert” on sexual orientation and gender identity, capped off “Pride Month” in June with his annual report to the Human Rights Council. The report addressed the conflicts between religious freedom and the rights of LGBTQ+ people to be “free from violence and discrimination.” Spoiler alert: Religious freedom loses. Madrigal-Borloz, a Costa Rican lawyer, has a long record of sacrificing religion on the altar of gender ideology, and this report is no exception. He claims, for instance, that laws influenced by “interpretations of religious dogma” often deny “lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trans and other gender-diverse persons the right to equality.” But nothing in human rights law requires that people, or governments, embrace the latest fetishes of gender activists. Human rights derive from our shared human dignity. Such rights include the fundamental rights to life, freedom of religion, and freedom of speech. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights speaks to these freedoms. But no global human rights treaty recognizes rights based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and for good reason: They’re parochial, not universal. This new report repeats an error of another U.N. report from 2020 on freedom of religion and gender equality. It, too, subordinates religious freedom to the dictates of LGBTQ+ activists. It claims religious believers are unjust when they act on the tenets of their faith. Do you support natural marriage, the reality of biological sex, and traditional sexual morality? Do your views reflect your religious beliefs?  If so, then the U.N.’s sexual orientation and gender identity czar likely thinks you’re guilty of discrimination or even violence. His new report, though, mainly targets countries with laws inspired by religious beliefs. He directs his ire particularly at laws involving same-sex relations, abortion, and conscience rights. In every case, his report puts religion in its crosshairs. Take the 67 countries that prohibit sexual acts between same-sex adults, for instance. The two sources of those laws, according to the SOGI czar, are “dogmatic interpretations of scripture,” and colonial-era legislation that has “morphed into norms invoking religion.” Again, religion is supposedly to blame for upholding the “wrong” norms about sex. Hungary’s law that bars same-sex couples from adopting children gets special attention. That law is “oppression,” according to the report. It’s a result of “applying a strict Christian conservative viewpoint to the legal definition of a family.” Even the U.S., where President Joe Biden is working to promote the agenda across the government, wasn’t spared. The report complains of “state legislatures seeking to enshrine anti-trans exclusion” in the U.S. as an example of how “religion can be invoked for autocratic practices and denial of basic rights.” In this case, however, the U.N.’s SOGI czar is shooting at shadows. Not one of the state laws in question relies on sectarian religious views. His animus toward religion is so extreme that he blames it—even in its absence. “Denial of Reproductive Rights” His report’s defense of abortion is even more shrill. It describes the “denial of reproductive rights”—read: abortion—as a “less explicit” form of “state-sponsored violence.” At least Madrigal-Borloz is consistent. When he visited the U.S. last year, he described the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade, as “a devastating action for the human rights of lesbian and bisexual women, as well as trans men and other gender-diverse persons with gestational faculties.” He also objects to laws that protect doctors and pharmacists who won’t provide “services that go against their convictions” as a form of “indirect discrimination.” He asserts that “one in eight LGBT people” live in states in the U.S. where doctors “can legally refuse to care for them.” That is false. No U.S. state allows health providers to turn away patients based on their sexual orientation or “gender identity.” Rather, some states protect providers who oppose, on moral and/or professional grounds, abortions and “gender-affirming care.” The U.N. SOGI czar simply defines these procedures as “care.” Does he think doctors and nurses should be forced to perform them? The report even weighs in on “access to spirituality for LGBT persons.” It frets about “alienation from organized religion.” The problem, once again, are religious teachings that contradict the sex and gender dogmas of the moment. His solution, then, is simple: Religions should get with the program and update their teachings on sex. Biden Administration’s Kudos To no one’s surprise, the Biden camp praised the SOGI czar’s report. Jessica Stern, U.S. special envoy for advancing the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons, delivered the government’s official statement welcoming the report. She described a “global trend of instrumentalizing and misusing religion, customs, traditions, and culture to justify discriminatory legislation.” Biden shares the U.N. czar’s radical priorities and contempt for religious freedom. His team has weaponized foreign aid and leveraged U.S. diplomacy to impose a radical social agenda at home and abroad. Despite claims to the contrary, their actions strike at the human rights system, of which religious freedom is the heart. Indeed, many argue that the concept of human rights depends on a Judeo-Christian framework and is in peril without it. If gender ideology contradicts the mores of every major religion, then surely the problem is not religion. The problem is the ideology itself. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

The hearing began in a rather unusual way—with a podcast. In a brief clip, Dr. Blair Peters, a self-described “queer surgeon” at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, explained that in the field of “gender medicine,” they are “just kind of learning and figuring out what works.” He went on to say, “We know almost nothing about these outcomes,” prompting Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., to describe the clip as “nightmarish,” a form of “barbarism,” and proof that these medical procedures should be prohibited by law. Ranking Democratic member Rep. Mary Scanlon, D-Pa., called the hearing an attempt to “motivate right-wing voters” and impose “ultra-conservative and religious views” onto the rest of America. She seems to have forgotten, however, that no parent has a constitutional right to injure their own children. She seems to have also forgotten that the federal government and every state and territory have child welfare laws on the books that recognize the appropriateness of government intervention when minor children are being subjected to physical, and in some cases, emotional harm by their custodial parents or guardians. In fact, a federal appellate court that then included the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg held in 2007 that medical care of any kind is not a constitutional right. Democratic member Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., led with a monologue on “bigotry” from the Republicans and their attempt to grab “15 minutes of fame.” Importantly, he made a flatly incorrect statement of law: that the federal circuit courts are in “alignment” that state bans on “gender-affirming” care are unconstitutional. In fact, a recent decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, when the court was considering such a state ban out of Tennessee, reached the opposite conclusion. The court in that case held that the state law did not violate either parents’ constitutional right to direct the upbringing of their children or constitutional protections that require all individuals to be treated equally regardless of sex. Some have posited that this case may now be headed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Next up, the 11th Circuit will hear a constitutional challenge to Florida’s gender-affirming medicine ban for minors. In a previous case, Adams v. St. Johns County School Board, that court determined that a school’s sex-segregated bathroom policy was not a violation of the Constitution because (just as the Tennessee ban does) it treated all students equally, regardless of sex. Finding that the law that restricted “transgender” students’ access to bathrooms that corresponded to their biological sex to be constitutional, it may well reach the same conclusion as the 6th Circuit when considering a law on transgender minors’ access to invasive medical treatments. Paula Scanlan, a former University of Pennsylvania swimmer, testified to the Judiciary Committee about the countless hours of effort she put toward her pursuit of a roster slot on an NCAA Division I swim team. In September of 2021, “Lia” Thomas (formerly Will) began swimming in her event. She testified about how this affected the women on the swim team who were forced to change and shower alongside a 6’4” male swimmer with male genitalia 18 times per week. The athletics department, Scanlan said, offered psychological “reeducation services” to the athletes who were uncomfortable with this. Scanlan’s pain was palpable as she described the refusal of the university to consider the impact of “Lia’s” presence on sexual assault survivors like her. May Mailman, a senior fellow at the Independent Women’s Law Center, addressed the legal implications of including transgender athletes on women’s sports teams under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. Title IX prohibits sex discrimination in any educational program that receives federal funding and was once the shining star of the feminist movement, creating sports, facilities, and other opportunities for women that parallel men’s. But the Biden administration’s Department of Education is in the process of developing a new Title IX rule that will dissolve legal protections for women in athletics, guaranteeing that Scanlan’s situation may soon become the rule and not the exception. Dr. Jennifer Bauwens, a clinical psychologist and the director of the Center for Family Studies at Family Research Council, testified that children are, and have always been, recognized to be a special and vulnerable class because they do not possess the capacity to make lifelong decisions. State laws that ban smoking, marriage, alcohol use, contracting, and more for those under the age of 18 recognize such an absence of capacity. Johnson pointed out that Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, the notably vocal Democratic member of the committee who was present at Thursday’s hearing, has herself previously admitted, “In essence, the brain doesn’t fully mature until about 25 years old. Does that tell us about high schoolers, middle schoolers, and yes, young people who may make rash, or irreverent, or spontaneous decisions? Should that be their life?” While Jackson Lee had made the statement within the context of a criminal law hearing, the principle cannot be applied indiscriminately. If minors are somehow incapable of fully understanding the criminal consequences of their actions, if state laws and longstanding legal principles recognize that minors lack the mental and emotional capacity to engage in life-altering conduct, these same children cannot be said to fully understand the likely effects of irreversible, dangerous, and experimental medical interventions. That’s especially true when gender dysphoria often masks other mental health disorders. Perhaps the most impactful testimony of the morning came from Chloe Cole—a young woman who once believed herself to be a boy but has since “detransitioned.” She was the subject of significant medical interventions to “treat” her gender dysphoria, including a double mastectomy at the age of 15. She testified she was a victim of biggest medical scandal in America, and that what she once believed to be her desire to transition was simply her discomfort with normal pubertal development and the intimidating and unwelcome male attention she received. Cole described the coercion her parents experienced in signing the consent forms that led her down a path to surgical intervention when they were asked, “Would you rather having a dead daughter or a living [transgender] son?” Democratic representatives and their invited witnesses repeated common talking points about uniformity of opinion among major medical organizations in treating gender dysphoric minors—among them, the American Academy of Pediatrics. But, as Bauwens testified, 80% of the American Academy of Pediatrics membership has asked for a review of the clinical literature on gender medicine—a request that has fallen on deaf ears. Several European nations, too, have backtracked from their original eagerness to provide gender transition interventions, including Finland, Sweden, Norway, France, and the United Kingdom—something the U.S. medical establishment fails to acknowledge. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., engaged in a heated exchange with Democratic witness Shannon Minter of the National Center for Lesbian Rights about the recently passed Washington state law that hides runaway gender-dysphoric minors from their parents if the parents do not support medically invasive “affirmations” of their transgenderism, calling it a violation of parents’ constitutional rights. While Minter countered that the law did not “hide children” from their parents, a close reading of the bill proves otherwise. Additional violations of parents’ rights are also occurring in school districts that are hiding from parents the social gender transitions of their children and the use of their children’s “preferred pronouns.” What’s clear from Thursday’s hearing is that the constitutional right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children is indeed being violated. But those violations are not occurring when states protect minors from getting experimental “gender-affirming” treatments. The violations are transpiring in blue states that are cutting parents out of the equation altogether. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

"], "text": "Last month, the Michigan House passed Bill 4474—legislation that would expand the state’s existing Ethnic Intimidation Act beyond current protections for religion, ethnicity and race, to categories including sexual orientation and gender identity or expression. HB 4474 would make it a felony hate crime offense to cause someone to \"feel terrorized, frightened, or threatened\" with words—deliberately misgendering someone, for example—subject to a potential penalty of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. The Left has been pushing its “words are violence” premise for some time. But Michigan’s willingness to go the extra mile and criminalize gender-related speech has summoned a ghoul from some dystopian fever dream. HB 4474 is unconstitutional, and I’m not the only lawyer who thinks so. To argue otherwise ignores two of the U.S. Supreme Court’s newly minted rulings on what speech the First Amendment protects—and what it doesn’t. >>> Public Opinion Is No Excuse To Ignore the First Amendment In 303 Creative v. Elenis, the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment prohibited the state of Colorado from forcing a website designer to create expressive designs conveying messages on same-sex marriage with which she disagrees. Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the majority, recited a long line of precedents establishing that the First Amendment not only protects an individual’s right to speak her mind, but prohibits the government from compelling her to “speak its own preferred messages.” Yet that’s precisely what Michigan proposes to do. Its preferred messages require affirmation of another’s gender identity on pain of criminal penalty—even if the speaker believes that sex is binary and immutable, and there are only two genders. In Counterman v. Colorado, the court examined the interplay between the First Amendment and criminal conduct—specifically, making “true threats” that are unprotected speech. The court held that for Colorado to prosecute someone for making a “true threat” of violence, it must prove a defendant had some subjective understanding of the threatening nature of his statements. Writing for the majority, Justice Elena Kagan noted that even though a true threat “lie[s] outside the bounds of the First Amendment’s protection,” prosecution of true threats poses “the prospect of chilling non-threatening expression, given the ordinary citizen’s predictable tendency to steer wide of the unlawful zone.” By requiring a showing that a defendant recklessly disregarded a substantial risk that his words could be perceived as threatening, a speaker would be prevented from—as Kagan wrote— “swallow[ing] words that are in fact not true threats.” That means a prosecution under Michigan’s hate crime law would require proof that the speaker knew his or her speech on gender identity or expression was likely to be perceived as threatening but acted with that knowledge by issuing the threat anyway. The speaker would therefore be acting “recklessly.” Yes, as the gender juggernaut sprints ever forward, it’s certainly likely that transgender individuals could perceive misgendering as “threatening.” They are, after all, the fraternity of the perpetually offended. However, to qualify as a prosecutable “true threat,” the speech must convey a threat to commit an act of violence; speech that is hurtful or offensive does not qualify and is protected speech under the First Amendment, regardless of whether the majority of Michiganders agree or not. >>> Mental Health, the Ambiguity of “Gender” and Protecting Families and Children Further complicating Michigan’s intention to silence dissent is the fact that at least one federal appellate court has held that gender identity is a “hotly contested issue,” one on which reasonable people can and do disagree. Indeed, the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals noted in Meriwether v. Hartop, that “the premise that gender identity is an idea ‘embraced and advocated by increasing numbers of people is all the more reason to protect the First Amendment rights of those who wish to voice a different view.’” Despite Democratic characterizations that HB 4474 is “common-sense hate crime legislation,” the expansion of hate crimes laws to speech concerning an individual’s subjective self-identification is anything but common. It compels alignment with the state’s preferred orthodoxy, something the Supreme Court has routinely struck down. What’s more, it points the way toward even bolder government efforts to censor unpopular or politically inexpedient speech. Whether concerning hate crimes, stalking or public accommodations, no law, as Gorsuch wrote in 303 Creative, “is immune from the demands of the Constitution.” A law that prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation (such as Colorado’s public accommodations law), or establishes criminal penalties for speech based on gender identity or expression (like HB 4474) must still conform to the First Amendment’s protection for the freedom of speech. The government may not prohibit expression merely because it might prove offensive to some or run contrary to its stated policy objectives. Disagreement is not discrimination, and while Michigan’s House Democrats appear to have forgotten this, their Senate colleagues would do well to remember it."},

This could be done through the Protecting Life and Taxpayers Act. "], "text": "Planned Parenthood’s 2021-2022 annual report is out: Taxpayer funding is at an all-time high and abortion remains a key priority. Meanwhile, visits for actual health care—like cancer screening and prevention services and prenatal care—continue to decline. The abortion giant has also been diversifying its portfolio of services, trying to corner the market in so-called transgender services. The Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade last summer, will loom large over any analysis of abortion data. But this annual report actually covers health-related data from 2020 and 2021 and financial data for only part of 2022. That means we’re still many months away from seeing how Roe’s demise is affecting Planned Parenthood’s abortion numbers—and its bottom line. The data we have now is important, though. Here are some key takeaways you should know. In the medical data section, Planned Parenthood reported: Planned Parenthood performed 208 abortions for every adoption referral. Meanwhile, the number of patients Planned Parenthood saw (2.13 million) declined yet again. The Charlotte Lozier Institute, a pro-life research and education organization, points out the shocking long-term decline in actual health services. Since 2010, breast exams are down 74%, Pap tests are down 70%, prenatal services are down 85%, and contraceptive services are down 36%. On the financial side of things, the contrast is striking. Planned Parenthood reported: The Dobbs decision came down on June 24, 2022. This financial data covers up to June 30, 2022. So, while the financial data is more up to date than the report’s medical data, we still can’t know the full effect of the Dobbs decision on Planned Parenthood’s bottom line. We know plenty about the changing abortion policy landscape post-Dobbs, though. Over a dozen states now protect women and unborn children through all nine months of pregnancy, with still more states providing strong protections that are in effect or under litigation. Abortion clinics in pro-life states have stopped doing abortions or moved to abortion-friendly states. Planned Parenthood’s national office has announced layoffs—to the tune of about 100 employees—coming this month. Planned Parenthood has also revealed its game plan going forward. It will increase funding for things like sexually transmitted disease testing, contraception, and so-called gender-affirming care. Planned Parenthood’s aggressive buy-in on radical gender ideology isn’t new. Long before Dobbs, the abortion giant was methodically diversifying its portfolio of offerings. But the numbers reveal just how quickly Planned Parenthood is cornering its share of the market. Planned Parenthood first mentioned providing “hormone treatments for transgender patients” in its 2014-2015 annual report. It had 26 centers in 10 states providing these interventions. In the latest report, Planned Parenthood says that “41 affiliates provide gender-affirming hormone therapy.” And when you look at the data, the numbers are even more shocking. The meteoric rise in the “Other Services” category is astounding. And by Planned Parenthood’s own admission (it isn’t exactly making the press rounds bragging about providing other types of services in this category), we know that transgender “health care” makes up the bulk of the dramatic rise. Planned Parenthood doesn’t provide a breakdown of transgender services alone. They’re buried in the “Other Services” category, bundled in a sub-category called “Other Procedures.” This category includes things like pediatric care, preventive care, and infertility services. “Services” are counted by “discreet clinical interactions,” not by the number of individual patients. If Planned Parenthood gave one patient a free condom, a pregnancy test, a sexually transmitted infection test, and an abortion over the course of a year, that would count as four different services. This is how Planned Parenthood downplays how central abortion is to its business: It muddies the math by giving an abortion procedure the same weight as providing a simple pregnancy test or free condom—they are all counted as one “service.” Moving forward in a post-Dobbs landscape, expect to see Planned Parenthood aggressively continue its abortion activity in liberal states. And everywhere Planned Parenthood has a footprint—even if it isn’t performing abortions there—you can bet that transgender services are (or will probably someday be) on the menu. Congress, for its part, has a long to-do list to protect life in a post-Dobbs world. The Heritage Foundation has provided a road map for how to get started. At the very least, Congress should defund Planned Parenthood. This could be done through the Protecting Life and Taxpayers Act. It would require that groups seeking federal funding certify that they won’t perform abortions or fund other entities that do. Federal policymakers have an opportunity to advance robust pro-life policies in the 118th Congress. Making sure Planned Parenthood doesn’t get another penny of taxpayers’ hard-earned money should be a priority. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

It destroys it."], "text": "From the boardroom to the cash register, big businesses have gone woke for “Pride.” But consumers finally seem to have had their fill. In a matter of weeks, Target and Anheuser-Busch lost a combined $40.8 billion in market value over their LGBTQ+ Pride-focused marketing campaigns. Their corporate collapses should be a warning for other businesses: Pride comes before the fall. The madness began with March madness, at least for the maker of Budweiser. The beer giant, likely thinking of the publicity and applause it would receive from woke elites, launched a promo featuring transgender activist Dylan Mulvaney. And publicity is what Anheuser-Busch got. To date, the beer-maker’s market capitalization has fallen around $27 billion. Target—which adopted a gender-neutral bathroom policy in 2016—was likewise eager to jump on the Pride bandwagon, but tried a different route. It released nationwide Pride-focused merchandise targeting children, including “tuck friendly” swimsuits for boys who identify as girls, but have not yet amputated their sexual organs. For good measure, it also offered kid-friendly products designed by a self-identified “trans Satanist.” It, too, paid dearly, losing $13.8 billion of its market capitalization. And as it fell, the rap song “Boycott Target” soared to the top of iTunes charts. Target claims the collapse is due to economic factors such as a possible recession. CNN has jumped in to defend the company, arguing that “broader changes in the U.S. economy, the possibility of a recession, and Target’s overexposure to discretionary merchandise” were to blame. But the data says otherwise: During the same period, rival Walmart’s stock price climbed slightly, and that of Kohl’s hardly changed. While the value of Anheuser-Busch and Target continues to plummet, the magnitude of their losses makes one wonder how they failed to foresee such a disaster. That Big Business is marketing Pride isn’t a surprise. What is a surprise—especially for Anheuser-Busch and Target—is that consumers do, indeed, have their limits when being bombarded with liberal sexual orthodoxy. The transgender ideology has been pushed on average Americans by political, academic, and corporate elites for years, with an uptick after President Joe Biden’s inauguration in January 2021. Unable to persuade moms and dads that their otherwise healthy children should undergo genital mutilation, rather than seek psychological treatment for underlying mental health conditions, trans activists turned to these cultural elites for help. Radical politicians in blue states, for instance, are using their state pension funds as leverage to shape the liberal corporate governance policies of investment firms such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street. And because these firms control more than $20 trillion in investment capital, they in turn are able to redefine business practices (including Pride campaigns) across the country. Why bother to try to pass a pro-trans bill when you can simply buy your preferred agenda? That’s to say nothing of the financial incentives behind the pro-trans marketing push. The sex-reassignment market stood around $1.9 billion in 2021 and is projected to grow to $5 billion by the end of the decade. Some posited that the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index was behind Bud Light’s decision to partner with Mulvaney. Now, the Human Rights Campaign’s Healthcare Equality Index for hospitals purportedly measures the “equity and inclusion of their LGBTQ+ patients.” Among others, the index is funded by (drumroll, please) … Pfizer—the same Pfizer that makes the puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones administered in the most “equitable” health care facilities across the country. If activists can persuade Big Business to market transgender ideology, they can ensure that those projections will become reality. More gender-dysphoric kids means more dollars for pro-trans lobbyists, medical professionals, medical facilities, and even government agencies to ensure “inclusion” and “health care” for these “marginalized” folks. But parents are literally not buying it. They understand that children are unprepared to make life-altering decisions about their bodies or to become sexually active at such young ages. They know that kids believe all kinds of things when they’re children that they will later renounce as they mature into adulthood. And they recognize that when their children face complex mental health challenges, those children need support, love, and talk therapy directed at treating underlying issues—not social, hormonal, and surgical transition to affirm a child’s false belief that he or she is another sex. Businesses exist to create a good or service of public value and to deliver a profit for their shareholders. But marketing transgender ideology does not (as Anheuser-Busch and Target now know too well) deliver shareholder profit or create consumer value. It destroys it. Transgender ideology also undermines what is good, true, and beautiful about each of us. It confuses children about their identities and pushes them to permanently harm their bodies—making them more depressed and suicidal in the process. Target isn’t creating value when it markets Pride-themed crop tops or tuck-friendly swimsuits. Target is destroying value—and itself in the process. No doubt, Target and Anheuser-Busch were convinced by narrow-sighted activists that uber-woke Pride campaigns would benefit their bottom line. But everyday Americans were quick to remind them of a basic economic principle: Producing goods and services of value results in profits. Promoting corporate woke ideology results in losses. America’s C-suites should take note lest they, too, go the way of Bud Light. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

Liam Morrison, a 12-year-old from Massachusetts, was sent home from school for wearing a T-shirt declaring in all capital letters: “THERE ARE ONLY TWO GENDERS.” The reason? Liam was told that his shirt made other students feel “unsafe.” Several months later, a federal trial judge ruled that the school likely was within its rights to do so. Liam’s attorneys at the public interest law firm Alliance Defending Freedom requested that the court prevent Nichols Middle School from prohibiting Liam from wearing such shirts to school while the case proceeds. Liam’s lawyers claim that school officials’ censorship of his message and the school speech policy on which that censorship was based violate the First and 14th amendments to the U.S. Constitution as a form of viewpoint discrimination. “This isn’t about a T-shirt; this is about a public school telling a seventh grader that he isn’t allowed to hold a view that differs from the school’s preferred orthodoxy,” ADF Senior Counsel Tyson Langhofer said. “Public school officials can’t censor Liam’s speech by forcing him to remove a shirt that states a scientific fact. Doing so is a gross violation of the First Amendment.” Judge Indira Talwani, however, concluded June 16 in L.M. v. Town of Middleborough that wearing such a shirt would infringe upon other “students’ rights to be ‘secure and to be let alone’ during the school day.” In doing so, Talwani, appointed by President Barack Obama, may have engaged in some acrobatic judicial interpretation. Two cases help provide an understanding of how student speech is regulated in public schools. In West Virginia v. Barnette (1943), the Supreme Court ruled that symbolic speech is protected within the free speech clause of the First Amendment, and that requiring all public school students to salute the American flag regardless of their individual moral or religious objections violated the First Amendment. Some years later, in Tinker v. Des Moines School District (1969), the Supreme Court extended and further clarified speech protections for students. In that case, the high court famously wrote that neither students nor teachers “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.” In Tinker, the Supreme Court found that the school administration unconstitutionally restricted the speech rights of students who wanted to wear black arm bands in protest of the Vietnam War. The court also held that school officials could prohibit student speech only if the speech was likely to disrupt the learning environment, stating that speech that “materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others is, of course, not immunized by the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech.” In the case at hand, Talwani acknowledged the Tinker case, but in her opinion and order denying Liam’s request to prevent his school from censoring his symbolic speech, she wrote: Importantly, the portion of the Tinker opinion from which Talwani pulls that last sentence reads in full: Liam—in protest of the nation’s growing obsession with gender identity—also silently and passively expressed his opinion, “unaccompanied by any disorder or disturbance.” It’s hard to see exactly how his simple wearing of a T-shirt would not fit within the framework of the Supreme Court’s Tinker decision. Talwani also seems to have missed this distinction from the Tinker court: “[F]or … school officials to justify prohibition of a particular expression of opinion, it must be able to show that its action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint.” The “discomfort and unpleasantness” experienced by any LGBTQ+ students at Liam’s middle school seems to be the real issue in his case. More than just an exercise in judicial activism on the part of the judge, Liam’s case illustrates vividly how even noncontroversial, mainstream positions have become increasingly restricted in the space of gender identity and transgender “rights.” (Other attorneys have joined with this one in criticizing Talwani’s ruling, including here and here.) Real debate—not government mandate—is required when it comes to gender identity. This entire episode is a reminder of how easily “hate speech” arguments and “safe space” demands can mute the bravery and common sense of students such as Liam Morrison—who did not, as the Supreme Court remarked in Tinker, shed his constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gate.

This week, the Muslim-majority town of Hamtramck, Michigan, half of whose population are immigrants, decided that no flags representing specific religious, ethnic, or identity groups (for instance, Pride flags) should fly on government property. We agree. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is fighting against the growing consensus, pushing highly controversial gender ideology from the top down, both at home and abroad. Stateside, a U.S. Space Force general said earlier this month she takes access to \"gender-affirming care\" into consideration when it comes to appointing officers. Overseas, the State Department is not content to celebrate \"Pride Month\" by merely tweeting videos about gender identity and hoisting rainbow flags at U.S. embassies from Uruguay to the Holy See. They are intent on embedding gender ideology in U.S. foreign policy. For starters, the Biden administration aims to take on a straw-man of \"conversion therapy\" with a new worldwide plan to promote so-called \"gender-affirming care\" through U.S. diplomacy. Last month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken commemorated the day known as \"IDAHOBIT\"—International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia and Transphobia—by noting that President Joe Biden had directed the U.S. government to promote an end to so-called \"conversion therapy practices\" around the world. >>> U.S. Foreign Aid Used to Push Abortion, Gender Ideology Around the World What does Biden mean by \"conversion therapy?\" An Executive Order he issued last year defines it as any \"efforts to suppress or change an individual's sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.\" This definition is dangerously broad. It assumes that no one ever wants to change their sexual desires or the ways they express masculinity or femininity. A U.N. report on \"conversion therapy practices\" further clarifies Biden's meaning. The report equates \"faith-based\" practices with forcible methods. That is, it puts the use of \"electric shocks [and] nausea-inducing or paralysis-inducing drugs\" on par with \"submitt[ing] to the tenets of a spiritual advisor.\" Like this U.N. \"expert,\" the Biden administration conflates the horrors of someone being unwillingly and forcibly \"converted\" from a sexual orientation with voluntary counseling to help people control their sexual urges or to accept their actual, sexed bodies. As an alternative to such broadly defined \"conversion therapy practices,\" the State Department has pledged to promote \"SOGIESC [sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, and sex characteristics] affirming care,\" and to provide \"resources for families on expanding supportive and affirming behaviors with LGBTQI+ youth.\" That means promoting \"gender-affirming care.\" And what is that, exactly? As with other radical ideas, the positive-sounding moniker conceals a darker reality. Radical gender ideologues believe that as soon as a young person announces that he or she was \"born in the wrong body,\" or takes on any of a growing list of new \"gender identities,\" then the duty of a parent, teacher, or doctor is to affirm that belief and assist the young person in conforming to it. They consider any other sensible approach, such as \"watchful waiting\" or talk therapy, to be \"conversion therapy,\" and thus unacceptable. In other words, when someone is experiencing a conflict between his perception of himself and his physical body, the Biden administration believes the only acceptable thing to do is to change the body rather than the perception. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health, a powerful lobbying group, tries to dictate standards for \"gender-affirming care\" for children, adolescents, and adults alike. This begins with a social transition (adopting a new name, pronouns and clothing) and then often progresses to the use of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and/or surgery. Surgeries include double mastectomies, castration, and reconstruction of genitals into a non-functioning approximation of the opposite sex's. It's not for the squeamish. >>> The Trans Mind-Virus Is Mutating These chemical and surgical interventions are not reversible. They frequently lead to sterilization, and many people who pursue them experience severe and painful complications. Indeed, recipients who stay on this pathway tend to develop life-long medical and pharmaceutical dependency. Maybe that's why the medical industry pushes \"gender-affirming care\" so hard, despite the Hippocratic Oath to \"first, do no harm.\" In his Pride Month proclamation, Biden spoke of \"medically necessary health care\" for \"transgender youth.\" Growing evidence suggests, however, that the hurried affirmation of gender-confused teens has harmed rather than helped them. Unsurprisingly, confused children need time and counseling to come to terms with who they are amidst a cacophony of \"affirming\" voices who won't be there if they later realize that they've made a mistake—as many do. Acknowledging this fact, several European countries, including progressive darlings Norway and Sweden, have slammed the brakes on transitioning minors, loudly refuting the claim that the drugs and surgery involved are \"medically necessary.\" Secretary of State Blinken has stated \"that conversion therapy practices are... ineligible for support through taxpayer-funded foreign assistance grants and contracts.\" The truth is, the only \"conversion\" happening here is a woke U.S. government attempting to convert other countries—many of them traditional, conservative, and religious—to a toxic ideology using foreign aid and rapidly depleting diplomatic capital.

But feminism in its current form is a radical devolution: divorcing sex from gender, vilifying all masculinity as toxic, and warring against nature and the family. How do we take back a feminism that has become so distorted? And do we want to? It’s worth considering some of the reasons feminism resonated with women, to identify questions that remain unanswered, and challenges women will potentially always face. What is Feminism? The debate over taking back feminism is complicated by the fact that no cohesive and consistent definition of feminism exists. It seems the only thing that unites feminists is that they care about issues that are related, and sometimes only tangentially related, to women. Underlying that are strong disagreements about what is good for women and human beings and what encompasses a life well lived. Feminists can’t even agree on what defines “women.” For example, trans-exclusionary feminists rebel against the encroachment of trans women into female sports and spaces, while other feminists do not—at least publicly—voice such objections. Often, feminism is discussed as coming in three or more waves. First-wave feminists wanted to be treated as equal citizens, a project that culminated with the passing of the 19th Amendment, guaranteeing women the right to vote. Second-wave feminism of the mid-twentieth century focused on eliminating discrimination in the workplace and expanding educational opportunities. The movement soon allied itself with abortion advocates, connecting it to a Sexual Revolution ethos that saw marriage and family primarily as impediments to women’s personal goals and ambitions. Third and subsequent waves of feminism are even more difficult to describe and delineate, as factions within the movement have grown leaving no clear breaks from one wave to the next. The element that labeled gender a social construct has taken off and advocated for positions with radical implications, including transgender ideology. >>> How America Toppled the Patriarchy This summary of feminism is short and has proved inadequate for many women, not the least when women are attempting to discern how much gratitude they owe feminists. For the most part, conservative women agree that first-wave feminism was a positive development, but they abhor the Sexual Revolution and its offspring. The Sexual Revolution itself was not a monolithic and concentrated development but a rolling cultural and intellectual transformation that challenged sexual norms and interpersonal relationships. These challenges run from questioning traditional gender roles to the normalization and promotion of hook-up culture, pornography, and diverse sexual orientations. Contributors to the sexual revolution range from Playboy’s Hugh Hefner to psychologist Sigmund Freud, who emphasized the primacy of sexual urges in driving human behavior, to revolutionary Kate Millett, who aimed at the destruction of the nuclear family. Things get complicated with second-wave feminism and its relationship to the Sexual Revolution. Mary Harrington, author of Feminism Against Progress, and Ethics and Public Policy Fellow Erika Bachiochi have stressed the importance of distinguishing the two, contending that feminism ended with the Sexual Revolution. There is evidence for this thesis. As described by Sue Ellen Bowlder in Subverted: How I Helped the Sexual Revolution Hijack the Women’s Movement, abortion was not part of the National Organization for Women’s (NOW) original platform, but Betty Friedan was convinced by population planner Larry Lader (whose work was cited several times in Roe v. Wade) to add it to NOW’s agenda, and a minority of NOW women supported and rammed through that addition. Feminists played a political role in the Sexual Revolution but were not the Sexual Revolution’s main philosophical architects. For example, with the exception of Simone de Beauvoir, feminists do not feature prominently in Carl Trueman’s Strange New World: How Thinkers and Activists Redefined Identity and Sparked the Sexual Revolution, which superbly traces the intellectual history of the Sexual Revolution and transgender ideology. The Sexual Revolution owes a greater debt to philosophers like Karl Marx and Jean-Jacques Rousseau and psychologists like Sigmund Freud. Beauvoir added the key piece of separating sex from gender, with sex having to do with biology and gender being a social construct. The body was no longer essential, men and women were no different, and human beings were free to construct themselves as they saw fit. The relationship between feminists and Sexual Revolutionaries was in part a political alliance with some disagreement over ends and means. Some second-wave feminists had the goal of giving women the option of laboring outside the home (while sometimes unjustly disparaging the importance of work done within the home, including the character formation of children). But what was an end for those feminists was a means for Sexual Revolutionaries. For Sexual Revolutionaries, women achieving economic independence and being granted unlimited access to abortion and the pill were the means of destroying the nuclear family; they promoted the illusion that men and women are not interdependent, that they do not need each other to flourish. For example, feminist Betty Friedan never advocated for the destruction of the family, while the more radical Kate Millett did. Friedan was the author of the bestseller The Feminine Mystique, largely credited with launching second-wave feminism, while Millett’s Sexual Politics was featured twice on the cover of Time magazine and can be found on the reading list of women’s studies programs. Friedan saw Millett, who wanted to undermine heterosexual relationships, as sexualizing the women’s movement and famously labeled lesbian activists like Millett “the lavender menace.” “During their lives, Millett and Friedan came to represent two clashing ideologies, dueling approaches to a movement that is still a work in progress.” While prominent figures were disagreeing over the direction of the movement, many everyday women simply wanted reasonable alterations in the workforce and education. In 1971, 65% of women had never heard of Gloria Steinem, nor 63% of Germaine Greer, nor 64% of Kate Millett, according to Christopher Caldwell’s The Age of Entitlement: America Since the Sixties. And opinion polls from the 1970s indicated that while most women supported “efforts to improve women’s status,” they were “unsympathetic to women’s liberation groups” and believed activists’ actions were “unwomanly.” The women’s liberation movement opened itself up to an alliance with the Sexual Revolution because it was, at best, not grounded in a thorough understanding of the human person and, at worst, rejected human nature. This is somewhat unsurprising, as feminism has never been a comprehensive philosophy in and of itself. As University of Notre Dame professor Abigail Favale has explained, the varying waves of feminism have been defined by distinct underlying philosophies that give them their shape. First-wave feminism was animated by liberalism, second by Marxism, and subsequent waves by radical postmodernism. In many ways, the achievements of first-wave feminism are those of liberalism itself, extended to women. Politics, Not Philosophy We can understand feminism in another manner. On the whole, feminism is not a philosophy but a series of political movements. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, and—to a certain extent—Betty Friedan saw injustices in the law and our institutions and sought to correct them, sometimes in a piecemeal fashion. These women were activists, not philosophers, so we perhaps should not expect precise consistency and foresight from them. This is not to disparage grassroots feminists and everyday women over philosophers. Philosophy is a source of the highest truth, but in academia, so-called philosophers are often perpetrators of follies shockingly lacking in common sense. As Cicero quipped, “There can be nothing so absurd but may be found in the books of philosophers.” The belief that men and women are perfectly interchangeable is something only those in ivory tours can maintain; women in middle America observe the obvious, innate differences in their children, husbands, and brothers. Feminist philosophers are in short supply. While Mary Wollstonecraft and Simone de Beauvoir come to mind, their views are very different and often diametrically opposed. Wollstonecraft was a first-wave feminist who cared about education and emphasized duties as well as rights, while Beauvoir believed in radical creative autonomy, that “one is not born, but becomes a woman.” It seems odd that they would both be grouped under the same feminist umbrella. And there is, of course, no official body that determines who is and is not a feminist. In Sexual Politics, Kate Millett attempted to position herself as continuing the work of first-wave feminists who had begun the “sexual revolution.” This is a good rhetorical strategy, as many women look back on first-wave feminism with fondness. That positioning made her arguments seem more conservative and perhaps palatable by association. Yet Millett advocated for the destruction of the family and the sexualization of children. These contentions are certainly not in keeping with the principles of first-wave feminists, many of whom were Quakers. (Millett, by labeling herself a first-wave feminist, offers another example of why we should not take Marxists at their word.) Should We Revive Feminism? After this convoluted answer on how to define feminism, a natural follow-up question is: Should conservative and moderate women attempt to take back the term “feminism” from its radical modern adherents? To answer this question, we must ask another: For what purpose? Potentially, the term might be useful in advocating against sexual harassment in the workplace, or in promoting pro-life and family policies. While women still face many atrocities on the international front, and even though there will always be injustices in the world, modern American women have much to be grateful for. American women are equal citizens, and all educational and professional opportunities are open to us. The #MeToo Movement, before it radicalized, drew attention to sexual harassment in the workplace. While there was merit to highlighting this issue, it is unclear how much harassment actually permeated the professions. Moreover, it is unlikely that the problem of workplace harassment will be solved through additional regulations since there are plenty of laws already on the books to address such misconduct. The solutions for these issues will be found in seemingly unrelated places. The corrupted character of men who engage in such behavior was likely formed long before they enter the job market. Boys learn how to be good men primarily through example, and 40% of children are born out of wedlock. It is men with healthy masculinity who tutor and correct those of their own sex, and all manifestations of masculinity are currently being portrayed as toxic. Many of our boys are becoming addicted to online pornography, and there is a correlation between pornography addiction and sexual aggression towards women. Preventing workplace harassment, rather than just punishing it, will involve addressing some of these underlying causes. Doing so will also be good for women overall, as women struggle to find capable partners as husbands and fathers when men are in crisis. >>> Our Lost Boys Feminism today could perhaps further pro-life policies and encourage family formation. First-wave feminists “regarded abortion as an act of violence against an innocent unborn child,” according to Bachiochi’s The Rights of Women, so there are lessons we can learn from them. But the crisis of family formation did not exist for first-wave feminists or baby boomer second-wave feminists, and Sexual Revolutionaries like Millett sought the breakdown of the family. In this last goal, she and others have almost succeeded. The genesis of the crisis of family formation is complicated and multidimensional, and addressing it will require robust conversations between men and women and the revitalization of religion and our traditional institutions. When young women ask if we should take back feminism, my sense is what they really want to know is: What did feminism get right and how should women chart their lives in this increasingly confusing world? How do we understand dignified work in a manner that doesn’t yield to self-focused careerism but honors a dutiful definition of vocation that utilizes talents, fosters virtue, and serves others? How do we prioritize the goodness of marriage and family, especially when young men are struggling with things like pornography addiction and the Sexual Revolution has upended dating norms and promoted hook-up culture? Women can garner practical direction and guidance through the example of their peers and predecessors, by seeking feminine matriarchs who lead good lives and imitating their virtues and deliberate decisions. These are not easy questions that apply only to women. That we are reflecting on them as a society demonstrates a lack of understanding of the human person and what contributes to the good life. These questions are spiritual inquiries best illuminated by the comprehensive philosophical grounding of theology and natural law. But only part of this is intellectual. One of feminism’s insights is that middle-class women in the prosperous West are challenged by the competing goods of education, professional vocation, and family. We likely always will be so challenged, both collectively and individually, as the window for pursuing these goods overlaps considerably for women. If feminism is about finding an answer to this question, it is here to stay."},

"], "text": "Recently, I received separate inquiries from reporters working on stories about the use of the term “gender ideology.” What do I think it means? What is its origin? The requests, though they came from different reporters, were identical. This seemed suspicious. After all, these journalists showed no interest in explaining or analyzing the ideology that has passed through our culture faster than a viral particle through a loose-fitting surgical mask. They wanted to know, rather, whence this nasty right-wing slur, “gender ideology,” came. This seems to be part of a larger media campaign to discredit this and related terms. For instance, the new AP style guide advises, “Do not use the term transgenderism, which frames transgender identity as an ideology.” The Wikipedians are also doing their part. Something called the “anti-gender movement,” the website explains, “is an international movement which opposes what it refers to as ‘gender ideology,’ ‘gender theory,’ or ‘genderism.’ The concepts cover a variety of issues and have no coherent definition.” The giant online encyclopedia even quotes some European academics who claim the term is an “empty signifier.” Rubes who use this purportedly content-free word “include right-wingers and the far right, right-wing populists, conservatives, and Christian fundamentalists.” >>> The Uprising: Families Clash With Schools Over LGBTQ Propaganda The charge is not so much that the term gender ideology is unfair or inaccurate—which the AP suggests—but rather, that it doesn’t refer to anything at all. Yet clearly such an ideology exists and can be named. If thousands of people use a term to refer to the same set of related facts out in the world, then it both means something to them and has a referent. This is true no matter where the term originated, even if it’s hard for a random person on Twitter to formulate a tight definition on command. Anyone following politics in recent years already has some idea what “gender ideology” means and what it refers to. It gave us the Gender Unicorn. It inspires every new letter and symbol added to LBG in the Pride Month alphabet. It coaxes school districts to allow males who “identify as” females to compete in girls’ sports and use their bathrooms. It hypnotizes the media into pretending the man who won the decathlon in the 1976 Olympics is a woman. Gender ideology is the source of the belief that children can be born in the wrong body. It leads Californians to think that if a young girl feels anguish over her body, the doctors should not help her adjust to her body but should change her body and her surroundings—name, bathroom, pronouns—to conform to her “gender identity.” It fuels the spread of concepts like “gender identity”—including the many new supposed identities such as non-binary and pansexual—and the telling phrase “sex assigned at birth.” It inspires opaque proclamations like “transwomen are women.” It prompts the State Department under Joe Biden to fly the progress flag during Pride Month. It led Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to answer “I can’t…. I’m not a biologist” when she was asked “What is a woman?” during her Senate confirmation hearing to the U.S. Supreme Court. The ubiquity of gender ideology is why the Babylon Bee headline, “Bigoted Gender Surgeon Still Only Offering ‘Male’ and ‘Female,’” is funny. Get it? Of course you do. You know tacitly what gender ideology refers to. It’s ludicrous to pretend that these ideas have no nameable source. Still, defining an ideology is much harder than pointing to its effects. That’s why critics of gender ideology often come up short when challenged to do so. They might say, for instance, that it claims that people can change or choose their sex or gender at will. But that’s not what its adherents claim. Any good definition of a term should make explicit what its users already tacitly understand and refer to. It should also reveal the thing itself. In this case, it should capture the view of gender ideology’s champions who would much rather it continue to work its magic in the shadows, than be named—and so examined—under the glaring light of reason. Gender ideology is even harder to define than most terms because it refers to a protean postmodern confection. If you try to collect all the claims of its adherents over the years into a single long conjunctive proposition, as Ryan Anderson did in 2018, it looks downright incoherent. It is child’s play to point to its effects, but the thing itself is shrouded in obscurity and equivocation. Its proponents play a constant game of Motte and Bailey with the public, redefining familiar words and creating new variations of those words that only make sense within their own paradigm. As a result, one can’t really define gender ideology without invoking some of the terms it has already inserted into our language—terms that also cry out for definition. Nevertheless, it can be done—so long as we focus on its current incarnation. Recently, “gender-critical” physician Jeremy Shaw queried the Twitterverse for just such a definition. I sent one back without much thought—as one does on Twitter. It read: Gender ideology is certainly more than that. But it is at least that. On reflection, I’d replace “theory” with the less highfalutin “view.” Like all definitions, this one contains terms that are not themselves defined. It also contains terms that are artifacts of the ideology, such as “gender identity” and “sex assigned at birth.” According to Google’s dictionary function, “gender identity” is “a person’s innate sense of gender.” The term, we’re told, is “chiefly used in contexts where it is contrasted with the sex registered for them at birth.” So, we’re supposed to understand each of these terms in light of the other. This circular definition of gender identity is the standard. The word “gender” appears in both the definition and the term being defined—in both the explanans and the explanandum. Despite this deficiency, we can get a better sense of gender ideology by focusing on its use of “gender” and “sex.” To most outsiders, “gender” might look like a synonym for “sex”—as it has been for centuries. Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, for instance, recently tweeted ten “truths,” among them, “2. There are two genders.” It would have been better if he’d said, “There are [only] two sexes”—which is clearly what he meant. Why does this matter? Because gender ideologues tend to use “gender” as a shorthand for “gender identity”—as in the euphemism “gender affirming care” in medicine. Such “care” affirms the presumed gender identity of the patient, even if that means destroying the patient’s primary and secondary sex organs. In such a lexicon, “There are two genders” could mean “There are two gender identities,” which I doubt anyone would bother to defend. Gender ideologues, for their part, admit no limiting principle to the number of gender identities. And their critics should just say, “There are only two sexes.” >>> State Department Pushes \"Conversion Therapy\" Rather than denying the reality of sex outright, though, gender ideologues employ the now-ubiquitous substitute, “sex assigned [or registered] at birth.” They thus avoid using the word “sex”—the real biological difference between male and female human beings—and posit, instead, a mere social construct. It's no wonder normal people are confused. As bizarre as this is to those still in command of their senses, this gender lexicon is already so advanced that if you google, “What is the sex binary?” it will redirect, or rather misdirect, you to pages trying to debunk the “gender binary.” Google is clearly doing its part to advance the cause of gender ideology—though, according to recent polls, fewer and fewer people seem to buy it. Why do gender ideologues play such verbal shell games? Why pretend their view cannot be defined? It’s surely because they want it to be seen as a simple deliverance of science and sweet reason, rather than a dogma so outlandish that almost no one would accept it if it were explained precisely and without the threat of social opprobrium. The plain truth: Gender ideology does not accommodate the reality of sex—the reproductive strategy of mammals including human beings. Sex, in this reckoning, is not an objective truth about men and women. We are not male or female by virtue of our body structure or the fact that our bodies are oriented around the production of sperm or eggs. Human beings, are, in essence, psychological selves with internal senses of gender—like disembodied gendered souls. These “gender identities” are independent of, and can be incongruent with, the bodies that God gave us and that medicine has come to associate with “male” and female.” These “sex” categories are mere conventions, says the gender ideologue, not facts. For obvious reasons, gender acolytes rarely speak so bluntly. But don’t be fooled. When you see these confusing terms deployed to explain away what you know to be true, you can be quite sure you’re not dealing with sound science or sound philosophy, but with an incoherent kludge of concepts that we may rightly call gender ideology. I hope this clears things up for those curious journalists who seem to be perplexed by the term."},

Although this was a preliminary ruling, it has broader implications. The decision offers a glimpse at how the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health has dimmed the prospects for progressive litigators hoping to end public debate around important social questions through a well-worn dodge: enticing the courts to declare that certain conduct is constitutional “liberty” immune from democratic interference. Last year, when the Supreme Court released its decision in Dobbs, the topline takeaways were these: The Constitution contains no right to an abortion, and the scope of abortion access would henceforth be decided by the citizenry and their elected representatives. But even as Dobbs overruled two prominent decisions (Roe and Casey), it revived an approach distilled in Washington v. Glucksberg (1997), which appeared to have fallen into desuetude amidst the Court’s more recent ardor for discovering ahistorical constitutional rights—most notably, a right to same-sex marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges. In contrast to the boundary-defying humanism of Obergefell, Glucksberg was both more restrained and more rigorous. It held that conduct could not attain the constitutional status of fundamental liberty unless it was “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition” and carefully defined by reference to “concrete examples” within that record. Courts were not to deduce fundamental rights “from abstract concepts of personal autonomy.” Indeed, “the mere novelty” of an asserted right was “reason enough to doubt that [the Constitution] sustains it.” Although Dobbs did not overrule Obergefell, it reaffirmed that the Glucksberg approach would govern future cases where individuals asserted that their desired form of personal autonomy was a constitutionally protected liberty. >>> There Is No Constitutional Right to “Gender-Affirming” Care The present idée fixe in the autonomy genre is that individuals, often young children, ought to be able to “affirm” their gender identities and alter their physical appearances through hormone regimens and surgical interventions. Advocates of transgenderism seek to eliminate state laws like Tennessee’s, which restrict the availability of these experimental procedures; they do so by arguing that such laws are, among other things, unconstitutional infringements on liberty. As the latest exotic liberty claim to enjoy the support of tastemakers, transgenderism’s legal assertions were certain to collide with the Dobbs-Glucksberg line. Now that they have, those claims are worse for the encounter. Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton, joined by Judge Amul Thapar, explained that the parties challenging the law “are unlikely to prevail on their due process and equal protection claims” because “in each instance, they seek to extend the constitutional guarantees to new territory.” Among the difficulties for the law’s progressive detractors is that they are finding the boundaries of the word “liberty” less malleable than they had been before Dobbs. Their task is to make transgender procedures appear constituent of “ordered liberty,” when those novel procedures express a profound indifference towards given reality (biological sex) and enshrine intensely subjective, personal experience as the only valid criterion for assessing one’s identity. The ethos of the transgender movement is revolutionary, iconoclastic, and destabilizing of foundational certainties necessary to the maintenance of ordered liberty. The movement rejects the concept of authority external to the self, recognizing no higher authority than subjective individual perception. By making the boundaries between the sexes appear fluid, it subverts the concept of distinction: The ability to discern that permits the recognition and articulation of hierarchy and order. And by divorcing language—the “vehicle of order,” according to philosopher Richard Weaver—from reality, it makes language a tool of ideology, demanding that words denoting one sex be applied to the opposite sex. This is nearer to anarchy than it is to any cognizable form of order or liberty. Moreover, the putative right to inflict massive chemical or surgical interventions on one’s body too closely resembles the very type of liberty that Glucksberg rejected—the right to assisted suicide. From the constitutional perspective, it simply does not matter how profoundly intimate and personal these choices are. Anglo-American history, which Glucksberg sets as the touchstone, offers no analogue that allows us to understand them as rights immune from law’s application. As Sutton observes, “the challengers do not argue that the original fixed meaning of either the due process or equal protection guarantee covers these claims.” Nor can they identify a deeply rooted tradition of American support for their specific and radical notion of identity-affirming autonomy. The absence of such an understanding has hardly left the nation bereft of justice, as Dobbs and Glucksberg say the loss of true liberty would. American society has gotten on reasonably well for over two centuries without affording citizens an unrestricted right to treat their bodies like playdough. The implausibility of fitting naked transgenderism under the heading of ordered liberty has forced the challengers to Tennessee’s law to clothe their claims in more venerable garb. Transgender medical procedures are, they contend, part and parcel of parents’ rights “to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of their children.” That right has a pedigree, but that does not mean its boundaries grow with time to shield every parental choice from legal constraint. Does the ability to subject one’s child to experimental medical procedures occupy the same plane as the ability to direct a child’s education? Whether one talks of parents’ rights or those belonging to some other role, the concept of order implicitly supposes the concepts of design and purpose; that is, the ends or ultimate goods on which society has long agreed. There is an enduring belief that individuals, families, and the republic as a whole benefit from education, even as there is acknowledgement that this good may be obtained by a variety of educational routes. There is no such consensus regarding the personal or public good inhering in novel, medically aided efforts to manifest externally what one perceives about himself or herself internally. Framing the issue as one of parents’ rights does nothing to supply the missing historical consensus. >>> The Challenges of Judicial Restraint Lacking history and tradition, the challengers before the Sixth Circuit resorted to empirical science. Sutton noted that “many members of the medical community support the plaintiffs.” Fortunately, in this instance, the court was not disposed to let the challengers perform that peculiar modern alchemy that transmutes expert opinion into binding legal authority. Sutton and Thapar noted that the medical community abroad has expressed considerable doubt about the prudence of using hormone therapy for “off label” uses like gender transitions. And even at home, the Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve the uses the law’s challengers seek to make of hormone therapies. Still, Sutton noted that while not “dispositive,” the support of medical professionals “is surely relevant” to the merits of challengers’ claims. If it is, then it is only so in an attenuated sense. What if the FDA suddenly approves hormone treatments for the uses the challengers seek to make of them? Would that evidence that transgenderism is in fact deeply rooted in America’s history and traditions? Would that lessen the apparent novelty of transgenderism’s claims? The opinions, however learned, of a specialized subset of society do not seem to answer the question Sutton frames elsewhere: “whether the people of this country ever agreed to remove debates of this sort…[from] the democratic process.” The court is hearing a legal dispute where the inquiry turns on the traditional recognition of certain rights as immune from democratic interference. The medical community’s views on whether transgender procedures are “effective” in some sense shed little light on that question. To avoid confusing desires with rights, courts must determine the boundaries of liberty, not by reference to the half-empirical, half-political inclinations of certain professional classes, but by reference to history and tradition, the accreted wisdom of Americans and their predecessors across centuries. This was the insight of Glucksberg mercifully rediscovered in Dobbs. Its endurance in our legal system may preserve us collectively from the “moral extravagance” of creating rights “for the sake of novelty,” what Russell Kirk deemed “as dangerous an experiment as man could undertake.”"},

For decades, there has existed in Congress bipartisan support for humanitarian relief and other forms of foreign assistance, but that consensus is now threatened as federal agencies and the nongovernmental aid organizations they work with are increasingly promoting a far-left ideology and agenda in their programs—including climate change, abortion, and radical LGBTQ and gender ideology. The leftist agenda being pushed in these programs isn’t just threatening congressional support, it is alienating the nations that receive this much-needed aid. For example, the inclusion of abortion and the LGBTQ agenda in America’s flagship health program, the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (currently being considered for reauthorization by Congress), has angered leaders across Africa. On Tuesday, more than 100 parliamentarians and religious and civil society leaders from 15 African countries sent a letter to the U.S. Senate and House leadership thanking Congress for supporting this lifesaving program, but demanding that Africa’s pro-life, pro-family values be respected. If the Left continues to push its agenda on these nations, many may reject this program—one that has been credited with saving 25 million lives over the years by providing billions in funding for HIV/AIDS treatment, prevention, and research in more than 50 countries. This shift in focus in U.S. foreign assistance from humanitarian relief and economic development to the promotion of a politically partisan agenda by so many assistance providers at one time is not accidental. In fact, it is the result of a coordinated effort by a small but hugely influential organization called InterAction, which bills itself as the largest alliance of international humanitarian and development nongovernmental organizations in the United States. InterAction represents more than 150 charities, including many well-known organizations like the American Red Cross, Oxfam, International Rescue Committee, Islamic Relief, Catholic Relief Services, Care USA, Save the Children, and World Vision. InterAction plays both a coordination role for assistance providers and serves as a lobbying firm, seeking to influence legislators and legislation in Congress to increase funding for its priorities. Last year, InterAction facilitated the development of the DEI Compact: INGO Commitments Toward Greater Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, which commits member organizations to the promotion of the neo-Marxist diversity, equity, and inclusion ideology through their (taxpayer-funded) programs. InterAction also developed the NGO Climate Compact “to pledge concerted, unified, and urgent action to address climate change.” Through its organizational priorities and recommendations to the Group of Seven major industrialized nations, InterAction explicitly promotes a universal “right” to abortion and increased funding for “women’s rights and feminist organizations.” In the United States, InterAction advocates for far-left immigration and asylum policies even more extreme than those promoted by the Biden administration. The homogenous political orientation of InterAction is also apparent when reviewing political contribution records maintained by the Federal Election Commission, which show 100% of all InterAction employee contributions in 2019-2020 going to support left-wing candidates and causes. InterAction’s funding comes from NGO member dues, foreign governments (Switzerland and Sweden), the U.S. Agency for International Development, the United Nations, and a who’s who list of far-left foundations. The leftward tilt of U.S. foreign assistance driven by InterAction and its partners is damaging our standing in the developing world. While the foreign aid industry constantly talks about “empowering African voices,” the relentless neocolonialist promotion of leftist propaganda in socially conservative countries in Africa (most recently the promotion of the LGBTQ agenda in Uganda) has engendered hatred of the U.S. and pushback in the form of repressive laws and the rejection of U.S. assistance in favor of assistance from other sources (i.e., China). Another danger associated with promoting this partisan and divisive agenda through foreign aid is the risk of a breakdown in the bipartisan commitment to foreign assistance among Congress and the taxpaying public. To save the public consensus on foreign assistance, Congress should defund any programs (including the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) that promote partisan causes or political and ideological indoctrination as a condition for the receipt of lifesaving humanitarian aid. Congress should also ensure that no further taxpayer funding goes to support the clearly partisan InterAction. Congress should ask the IRS to determine if InterAction is still eligible for 501(c)(3) status, given its politically partisan orientation, and should ask the FBI to determine if it, as a lobbying organization that receives funding from foreign governments, has registered as a foreign agent.

But only because taxpaying parents and their brave kids are speaking up."], "text": "In a June like none other, where the LGBTQ agenda has been crammed at increasing velocity down the throats of unwitting Americans, everyday folks are reaching their limits. With two more weeks to go in “Pride Month,” this is bad news for the rainbow mafia. But it’s a sign of character and courage that the rest of us can take hope in—especially when demonstrated by families in the direct line of propagandistic fire. In response to the Left’s “sex-and-gender-everything” policies, parents and kids are both flexing their muscles in opposition to schools that are all in on “Pride.” Earlier this month, a group of students at Marshall Simonds Middle School in Burlington, Massachusetts, reportedly protested a “Pride Month” event by tearing down LGBTQ “Pride” signs and banners and chanting, “USA are my pronouns.” This prompted the Equity Coalition, an LGBTQ advocacy group, to demand that the Burlington school district discipline students involved in the protest and fill the district’s vacant position of director of diversity, inclusion, and equity, or DEI. In Huntington Beach, California, students at Edison High School revolted against a “Pride” video shown in math class. For their outbursts, their teacher threatened: “if you’re going to be inappropriate, I will have supervision down and give all of you a Saturday school for next year.” And a few miles up the California coast, in ultra-Left Hollywood, parents kept their children home from North Hollywood’s Saticoy Elementary School in protest of a planned “Pride Day.” The frustration extends beyond LGBTQ school events to curriculum and policies, too. Parents at an elementary school in Connecticut were infuriated after their 8-, 9-, and 10-year-olds were shown a video celebrating gender identity without the parents’ knowledge, and then given “puberty kits” to take home. One parent, Kyle Reyes, the father of four kids under age 9, decided to pull them all out of the Granby School District as a result of policies on sexual orientation and gender identity, saying: “These are conversations that, if anyone is going to have with their kids, it should be the parents having with their kids.” North of the border, at a large protest in front of an Ottawa school board led by Muslim Canadians but also attended by Christians and Jews, parents and kids voiced their opposition to radical gender ideology in the classroom. Much of their ire was directed at the school board’s recent mandate on gender-neutral pronouns, prompting chants of “Let the parents decide.” The divide between propaganda and common sense is no more readily apparent than in the context of scholastic sports—where Gallup now reports massive increases in the number of Americans who say biological sex—and not gender identity—should dictate participation in organized sports. Gallup notes: This finding tracks with a recent study indicating that 65% of Americans say they believe there are only two genders—an increase of six percentage points from 2021. Now, if school districts had been paying attention to such numbers and operated according to federal law and not the will of cultural elites and LGBTQ evangelists in the federal government, situations like those in Wisconsin and Vermont high schools might have been avoided. At East High School, in Wisconsin’s Sun Prairie Area School District, an 18-year-old biological male who identified as “trans” entered the girls’ locker room and showered naked in front of a group of terrified 14-year-old freshman girls. In a manifestation of what’s become a troubling trend on parental disenfranchisement, the school district chose not to contact the girls’ parents. Now, Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty is urging the U.S. Department of Education to investigate whether the high school violated federal civil rights law. A few weeks ago, a Vermont school district that punished a father and daughter for speaking out about a biological male using a girls’ locker room was ordered to cough up $125,000 in damages and attorneys’ fees. Considering this, the Wisconsin school district might want to get its legal house in order. LGBTQ talking points once focused on “equality” and wanting to “live and let live.” Now, yearlong “Pride” initiatives look more like a hostile takeover of government school systems. What with school libraries shelved with gay porn, LGBTQ curriculum, gender-neutral bathrooms, preferred pronoun policies, and gaslighting parents on the gender identities of their own minor children (frequently facilitated by school administrators), families finally have had enough. For once, the alphabet mob is back on its heels. But only because taxpaying parents and their brave kids are speaking up. As noted by Kyle Reyes, the Connecticut dad: “Parents are starting to come out of the woodwork, and it’s time to start fighting back.” And fight back they will.

", "While the central goal of the bill is laudable, the original text contained certain noxious provisions.", "Bipartisanship is possible. It just takes determined leaders willing to do what’s right."], "text": "In a rare show of bipartisanship last week, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed a bill to combat child sexual abuse material online and establish reporting requirements for online platform providers. The bill also reactivated a decades-old provision obligating certain organizations and professions to report suspected child sexual abuse. But it wasn’t just the bipartisanship of the bill’s passage that made it notable. It was what it took to get to bipartisanship in the first place. While it was originally littered with problematic language that opened loopholes for tracking and reporting religious entities and parents who might object to “gender transition” procedures or abortions for minor children, conservative senators worked hard across the aisle to make the bill one that both parties could support. Sponsored by Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, D-Ill., the Strengthening Transparency and Obligations to Protect Children Suffering from Abuse and Mistreatment Act, or the “STOP CSAM” Act (S. 1199), creates a user-friendly system for reporting and removal of child sexual abuse material online. It requires that all internet platform providers report occurrences of child sexual abuse material on their platforms to law enforcement’s cyber-crime tipline within 60 days of discovery. It also creates a civil cause of action against both the perpetrators who create the material and the online platforms that host it if they fail to report the material to the tipline. STOP CSAM updates the 1990 Stop Child Sexual Abuse Act, which laid the foundation for child abuse reporting, but senators saw a need for certain updates to address new technologies being used to promulgate the prohibited material. While the central goal of the bill is laudable, the original text contained certain noxious provisions, including the expansion of the definition of child abuse to include “psychological abuse” (including “coercion” or “intimidation”) without clearly defining those terms. As the parent of any teenager will tell you, minors feel “coerced” a lot. We can think of a few who feel coerced into taking out the trash or keeping curfew, for example. The dangers associated with such an expanded definition of “abuse” aren’t theoretical. Medical journals have already called for parents to be held criminally liable if they refuse permission for their children to get what is euphemistically known as “gender-affirming care” (genital-mutilating surgeries, puberty blockers, and other harmful “transgender” procedures). State delegates in Virginia have introduced legislation to criminalize parents who don’t agree to such procedures. Additionally, under the STOP CSAM’s original text, parents who choose to counsel teens away from having an abortion could potentially have been flagged for physical abuse under these expanded definitions. Existing federal law establishes robust child abuse reporting requirements on federal lands and in federally funded or contracted facilities. It also establishes certain categories of professionals required to report suspected abuse—those who would naturally engage with children in the course of their work, such as medical personnel, mental health professionals, teachers, and law enforcement officials. Beyond that, certain child abuse reporting requirements were narrowly extended only to individuals involved with youth athletics. As Durbin joked in the mark-up of the bill (the committee’s amendment process), existing child abuse reporting requirements applied to baseball teams but not the Cub Scouts. What he didn’t mention was that his original text tried to expand these requirements to many new entities, including religious schools, but not public ones. The original text of S. 1199 would have expanded the child abuse reporting requirements set up in the 1990 law to any entity that received $10,000 or more in federal funding at any time in history. However, it specifically carved out formula grants to states, and that would have excluded public schools that receive federal grants from these reporting requirements. What’s more, “federal funding” in the original bill text included any grant, contract, subsidy, loan, or insurance received through the federal government by any entity, including faith-based entities. Therefore, any religious school that received funding from, for example, a reduced-fee school lunch program could be required to report any employees who provide “religious guidance” regarding the harms of abortion or transgender treatments as committing child abuse. Or, for example, if parents take their child to a therapist who participates in the Affordable Care Act insurance program, the therapist might be forced to report those parents if they seek to prevent their minor child from undergoing a medically unnecessary, “gender-affirming” double mastectomy if the therapist considers it “coercive.” Thankfully, Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Ted Cruz, R-Texas, realized the impact this language could have on well-meaning parents and organizations or employees who provide “religious guidance” and were able to secure a delay in the bill’s mark-up to discuss the problematic provisions. After a few weeks of negotiations and drafting of various amendments, these senators were able to secure an agreement between Durbin and Sen. Lindsey Graham to apply an appropriate fix. Ultimately, the bill passed out of committee by a vote of 20-1, picking up co-sponsorships from Cruz and Sen. Josh Hawley along the way. This type of scenario has played out many times before on Capitol Hill but with very different results. In an increasingly polarized Congress, seemingly bipartisan bills addressing commonsense issues like maternal mortality or youth mental health hide obscure textual provisions that have potential widespread, detrimental implications on issues like abortion, gender ideology, religion, and parental rights. Generally, such provisions that are buried in the text go unnoticed until bills are signed into law. In this respect, getting things done quickly means sacrificing the hard work that ensures things get done “right.” But the STOP CSAM Act is a perfect example of good political teamwork: Early and clear communication about problematic provisions can lead to truly bipartisan solutions—or at least it can slow the pace of movement of fast-tracked legislation to allow for more deliberation. It takes members of Congress like Lee and Cruz, however—politicians who are willing to slow down so-called must-pass bills—in order to patiently and deliberately assess the legislation, identify concerns, draft appropriate fixes, and build a coalition for support among committee members. While it may not be a regular occurrence in the Senate Judiciary Committee mark-up process, bipartisanship is possible. It just takes determined leaders willing to do what’s right.

These Democrats are the true science deniers—deniers of biological reality, genetics, [and] XX/XY chromosome science.", "Title IX has apparently been swept into the dustbin of history with Democrats’ silent acquiescence. ", "What the Democrats are doing now constitutes a real war on women."], "text": "As March and Women’s History Month draw to a close, it’s worth taking a moment to ponder a rhetorical question posed earlier this month by the website SelfRelianceCentral.com: “Why Do Democrats Despise Women?” That’s not political hyperbole. It’s a serious—and legitimate—question. How else can one explain why elected Democrats nearly unanimously oppose efforts at the state level to prohibit gender-confused biological boys and men who “identify” as girls and women from competing in interscholastic and other athletic events against biological females? Forget climate change. These Democrats are the true science deniers—deniers of biological reality, genetics, XX/XY chromosome science—and they apparently have no qualms about transgender “women” (aka biological males) hijacking girls’ and women’s athletics and beating them at their own games. If girls and women have to be deprived of athletic accolades and awards—trophies, prize money and scholarships—to advance the transgender agenda, so be it, they seem to be saying. The website WashingtonStand.com on March 27 updated its ongoing tally, reporting that “there have been over 30 separate girls’ and women’s sports titles that have been won by biological males (or have included biological men as part of a winning women’s team) in the last 19 years, with the trend accelerating exponentially in the past three years.” >>> Why States Must Define Sex Precisely So, where’s the outrage—particularly among Democratic women, in and out of Congress—about this disgraceful commandeering of girls and women’s athletics by faux females? There isn’t any, as far as we can tell. To the contrary, Democratic Pennsylvania state Rep. La’Tasha Mayes unsuccessfully sought to pressure the University of Pittsburgh to cancel a March 27 speaking appearance by Riley Gaines at the school. Invited by the campus chapter of Turning Point USA, Ms. Gaines—a 12-time NCAA All-American swimmer who lost races to trans swimmer Lia (aka William) Thomas—has been highly critical of intersex athletic interlopers. In that same vein, why won’t elected Democratic women speak out against those same trans “women” invading girls’ and women’s private spaces, from restrooms to locker rooms? If you’re female and you object to sharing those intimate facilities with “women” splaying male genitalia, you—not they—are the problem. Last year marked the 50th anniversary of the passage of Title IX, which was intended to level the athletic playing field for girls and women. Title IX, however, has apparently been swept into the dustbin of history with Democrats’ silent acquiescence. To add insult to injury, the Biden administration is seeking to amend Title IX through administrative rulemaking to have it prohibit not only discrimination on the basis of sex, but also on the basis of gender identity. That would be an end run around Congress, which is highly unlikely to agree to that change, and it’s certain to face legal challenges. Democrats’ silence was also deafening when the White House on March 8 hosted an International Women’s Day event that honored a “group of 11 extraordinary women from around the world who are working to build a brighter future for all.” One of the 11 honorees was a biological male. But perhaps the most appalling example of all came a year ago last week, on March 22, 2022, at federal Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s Senate confirmation hearing, when Biden’s Supreme Court justice-to-be couldn’t or wouldn’t answer Sen. Marsha Blackburn’s basic biology question: “Can you provide a definition for the word ‘woman’?” To which Ms. Jackson responded, “I can’t. … I’m not a biologist.” >>> HB 6: The Save Women’s Sports Act None of the 16 Democratic women in the Senate criticized Ms. Jackson’s answer, much less voted against her elevation to the Supreme Court, where cases involving these issues will surely be argued, likely sooner rather than later. “Silence is assent,” the left used to tell us in other protest contexts. Hence, Democrats’ failure to object to any of this is effectively assenting to the fraudulent construct of transgender “women” (an estimated .003% of the population) with its concomitant dissing of real females (51% of the population). That’s the price of the transgender cultural revolution that radical leftist Democrats—apparently including self-loathing biological women, perhaps suffering from a bizarre form of Stockholm syndrome—are fighting at every turn to impose. It all serves to underscore what a difference a decade makes. Remember when, after the GOP won control of Congress in the 2010 midterm elections, Democrats began accusing Republicans of waging a “war on women” because of pro-life legislation they were proposing? By contrast, what the Democrats are doing now constitutes a real war on women. If it weren’t for squeamish country club Republicans with an aversion to social issues and their overpaid, underachieving campaign consultants who seem to think marginal tax rates are the be all and end all of campaign issues, Democrats could be made to pay a steep price at the polls for despising women."},

"], "text": "In the dark of night on the last day of the legislative session in Washington state, Senate Democrats passed Senate Bill 5599, a breathtaking evisceration of parental rights. The bill would allow the state to legally hide runaway children from their parents if the parents don’t consent to their child’s “gender transition” or abortion. No allegation of abuse in the household is required. This bill also applies to children from other states who may travel thousands of miles for such procedures not available to them at home, cementing Washington as a “sanctuary state” for runaway teens. And if that wasn’t enough, the bill allocates up to $7.5 million of Washington taxpayers’ money to the Office of Homeless Youth Prevention and Protection to provide grants to organizations to pay for gender transition and abortion procedures. All Democrats voted yes; all Republicans voted no. Sure, Washington’s bill does lip service to providing parents with notification of the whereabouts of their runaway minor children. But there is no such obligation if a “compelling reason” exists not to do so. And that’s the bill’s real poison. As described in Section 2 of the bill, a minor’s desire to seek “protected health care services” is a compelling reason not to notify parents of the child’s location or to seek parental consent before those health care services are delivered. The definitions of “protected health care services” are cross-referenced from another Senate bill, SB 5489 (titled the “Shield Law”), and include all “gender-affirming treatments”—whether medical, surgical, social, behavioral—and all “reproductive health care services”—including abortion, contraception, and/or “assisted reproduction” (in vitro fertilization). Together, these bills clear the way for children between the ages of 13 and 17—without their parents’ knowledge—to stay at shelters that welcome runaways for an indefinite time while they seek these procedures. The bill is the brainchild of state Sen. Marko Liias, a Democrat, who has positioned it as a necessary protection for minors seeking access to “safe shelter” when their home environments are “unsupportive.” After the Senate’s passage of the bill, Liias said, “We know that young people experiencing homelessness are exposed to dangerous and harmful outcomes … This legislation ensures that our trans youth have safe options and access to secure, stable shelter when they may not be welcome at home.” Liias did not elaborate on what those “dangerous” or “harmful” outcomes might be. As co-chair of the LGBTQ Caucus in the Washington Senate, Liias is known for his efforts to promote prevailing progressive orthodoxy and eliminate parental rights and religious dissent when it comes to legislation related to sexual orientation and gender identity. He has pushed bills to require schools to adopt policies that “protect trans kids from bullying” and to ban so-called conversion therapy. He has also championed the Gender Affirming Care Act, which guarantees that Washingtonians who identify as “transgender” and “gender diverse” can receive what the act calls “medically necessary” treatment by prohibiting health insurers from denying or limiting coverage for so-called gender-affirming treatment. The weight of popular opinion is overwhelmingly against Washington’s runaway sanctuary bill. As the Washington Senate Republican Caucus pointed out, analysis of the online commentary on the bill indicates that nearly 80% has been negative. And when SB 5599 received a hearing before the Senate Human Services Committee back in February, more than 4,700 public comments were received, with 98% of them in opposition. In a statement after the bill’s introduction, state Senate Republican Leader John Braun issued a statement pointing out its utter madness: The horrifying reality is that Washington’s bill is not the first of its kind, nor is it likely to be the last. Within a few months of Washington’s introduction of the bill, California—already a “sanctuary state” for minors seeking so-called gender transition—fell in line and introduced a similarly devastating bill. The California proposal would allow a minor to obtain “gender-affirming” mental health interventions without parental knowledge or consent. But all is not lost. Some states are taking the opposite approach of California and Washington. In response to increasing attempts to transition children in the state of Missouri, for example, Attorney General Andrew Bailey recently issued an emergency order restricting the use of experimental transgender interventions on minors. His order was backed by a group of doctors, nurses, and health care professionals, despite the predictable hue and cry of “bigotry” from transgender activists. In addition, bills like California’s and Washington’s are so devastating to parental rights that they are unlikely to survive a legal challenge. As I’ve written about here, the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized for at least 100 years that the Constitution protects parental rights to direct the upbringing of their children. As recently as 2000, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that parental rights were among the “oldest of our recognized fundamental rights.” In the meantime, parents who are skeptical of government efforts to divest them of their right to parent their kids might want to start looking for real estate in places like Missouri.

Pretending Congress can resuscitate it will not only fail but further erode public confidence in Congress itself."], "text": "Earlier today, the Senate voted 51–47 on whether to consider Senate Joint Resolution 4, which purports to eliminate the seven-year ratification deadline in the 1972 resolution proposing the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). With fewer than 60 votes, the cloture vote failed, but every senator, whether supportive of or opposed to the ERA itself, should have rejected this charade. Senator Ben Cardin (D., Md.) has introduced similar resolutions every other year for the past decade. Why did he keep starting over? Because, as every member of Congress knows, bills or resolutions that receive no action during the two-year Congress in which they were introduced expire when that Congress finally adjourns. Resolutions that Congress passes to propose a constitutional amendment also have expiration dates. If Congress passes a resolution to propose a constitutional amendment without a ratification deadline, it remains pending before the states until, per Article V of the Constitution, three-fourths of the states ratify it. While that usually happens quickly, the most recent ratification, of the 27th Amendment regarding congressional-pay raises, took more than 200 years. A resolution to propose a constitutional amendment that does have a deadline, however, expires when ratified by three-fourths of the states or when the deadline passes with insufficient state support, whichever comes first. That was the fate of the 1972 ERA. Congress proposed it on March 22, 1972, with a seven-year deadline. Thirty-five states ratified it by the deadline, short of the three-fourths threshold, and five of those ratifying states had already withdrawn their support. >>> Gloria Steinem Was Right: The 1972 ERA Is Dead Congress passed a resolution purporting to extend the original deadline to June 30, 1982, but no additional state got on board. The tally remained at 30 unrescinded ratifications. This is why the Congressional Research Service has repeatedly observed that the 1972 ERA “formally died on June 30, 1982.” It expired more than 40 years ago and is no longer pending before the states to be ratified, let alone pending before Congress to be retroactively amended. This is why the Cardin resolution, and today’s vote on it, is a genuine charade. Congress cannot amend a resolution that it passed more than 50 years ago and that no longer exists. Cardin’s current resolution, however, has some new language that presents its own problems. Unlike the previous versions, Resolution 4 also declares that the 1972 ERA has already been fully ratified and is part of the Constitution. Even if Congress had any authority to make a proposed amendment part of the Constitution, the idea that the 1972 ERA has been ratified is patently false. It is based on the fiction that three states—Nevada, Illinois, and Virginia—validly ratified the 1972 ERA in the last several years, decades after it had ceased to exist. Congress has no such authority anyway. Cardin should read Article V of the Constitution that he has sworn to support and defend. Congress’s only powers in the constitutional amendment process are to propose amendments and to choose their “mode of ratification,” that is, whether states must act through their legislatures or in conventions. That’s it. Even liberal constitutional scholars, including those whose views congressional Democrats are normally eager to promote, agree on this. The late Duke Law School professor and former acting solicitor general Walter Dellinger, for example, wrote that Article V “requires no additional action by Congress or by anyone else after ratification by the final state.” “The creation of a ‘third step’—promulgation by Congress,” he said, “has no foundation in the text of the Constitution.” Both parts of the Cardin resolution—amending a 50-year-old resolution that no longer exists and asserting authority that Congress does not possess—make that resolution a legislative absurdity. To be sure, the Senate or House votes on legislative measures that, with no hope of passage, promote a particular message. Those measures, however, are typically real; the Cardin resolution is pure fiction. >>> The Constitution Created the District of Columbia and Only the Constitution Can Make It a State The truth is that ERA supporters in Congress have introduced more than 1,100 resolutions to propose the ERA since its first appearance a century ago. Representative Martha Griffiths (D., Mich.) introduced one in six successive Congresses before; after she agreed to add a ratification deadline, her colleagues finally voted to propose it. She kept starting over because, each previous resolution having expired, she had to. Starting over is the only option for ERA supporters today. No less a women’s-rights pioneer than the late justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg urged them to do just that. In an interview a few months before her death in 2020, Ginsburg said: ERA supporters are desperate to find signs of life in the 1972 ERA because it is the only ERA that Congress will likely ever propose. Less than one year after the 1972 ERA died, Congress voted 278–147 (far below the necessary two-thirds) on a resolution to propose the identical language. And it has only become more controversial since, with advocates saying it could be used to establish abortion rights, promote the LGBTQ agenda, and much, much more. The 1972 ERA is dead. Pretending Congress can resuscitate it will not only fail but further erode public confidence in Congress itself."},

Bigoted. Christo-fascists. After all, the transgender contagion was not spreading, drag was just an art form, and school employees were not facilitating children’s social gender transitions and hiding it from their unwitting parents. Except, none of this was true. Turned out, the trans movement pointed not to a slippery slope, but to a cliff. Earlier this year, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), a self-described defender of human rights around the world, presented to the United Nations Human Rights Council a report titled The 8 March Principles for a Human Rights-Based Approach to Criminal Law Proscribing Conduct Associated with Sex, Reproduction, Drug Use, HIV, Homelessness and Poverty. Among the report’s recommendations and policy statements were these gems: “sexual conduct involving persons below the domestically prescribed minimum age of consent to sex may be consensual in fact, if not in law,” and “enforcement of criminal law should reflect the rights and capacity of persons under 18 years of age to make decision about engaging in consensual sexual conduct.” >>> Conservative Senators Stop Weaponization of Child Abuse Bill Against Parents Opposed to Abortion, “Transgenderism” for Children These statements directly contradict Article 34 of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, which obligates all signatory nations to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse. Yet the U.N. received and highlighted the report. As for the ICJ’s premise that pesky age-of-consent laws should be ignored, because sex with minors isn’t really the social evil we think it is—well, so much for the human rights of children. In the States, Leigh Finke, a transgender-identified (biological male) legislator in Minnesota, drafted a bill declaring Minnesota a “refuge state” for the medical transitioning of minors, and has now proposed an amendment to state legislation that would classify “sexual attachment to children” as a protected sexual orientation. In Colorado, twenty-seven Democrats in the State House of Representatives just voted against making indecent exposure to minors a felony, with one legislator commenting that the criminal prohibition unfairly targets the drag and trans communities. And in Washington state, Democrats passed Senate Bill 5599, which would allow the state to legally hide runaway children from their parents if the parents don’t consent to their child’s “gender transition” or abortion. Clinical research is even being done on the distinctive features of particular populations with sexual attraction to children. Two researchers recently focused on the unique experiences of “minor attracted” women, for example, and called the link between “minor attraction” and “sexual offending against children” theoretical. The link can hardly be called “theoretical.” Although some individuals who are sexually attracted to minors may resist the urge to act on their impulses, many will not. It is estimated that 30 percent of one-time and 61 percent of three-time male child-sex offenders are pedophiles. Acknowledging this reality, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders defines pedophilia by either impulse or behavior. In 2022, the Moore Center for the Prevention of Child Abuse at Johns Hopkins University proudly touted its hire of a non-binary professor after she had resigned from Old Dominion University. She left ODU because of an uproar over her normalization of language on “minor-attracted persons,” which she preferred to the more “stigmatizing” word “pedophile.” Progressive culture has insidiously moved the needle on the notion of sex with minors now that transgenderism is in its heyday. It employs a favorite tool of persuasion: kids. Just a few days ago, a drag show in New York sponsored by a gay hookup app featured a 13-year-old “drag kid.” Advocacy of purportedly age-appropriate books like Gender Queer (thank you, National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers)—with its full-color illustrations of minors engaging in fellatio—has infected public school libraries and triggered school board meetings rife with irate parents. A teacher in Texas was fired after undercover footage indicated her jaw-dropping near-advocacy of pedophilia to a classroom full of minor children: “We’re gonna call them MAPs, minor-attracted persons. So don’t judge people just because they wanna have sex with a five-year-old.” Um, what? There also appears to be a connection between medical gender interventions and pedophilia advocacy. The relentless push for gender-affirming “healthcare” for minors posits the notion that castrating healthy boys or giving healthy girls double mastectomies is “settled” science. (In fact, it is anything but.) It grants medical professionals, who have a financial interest in performing such surgeries, a license to do so under the guise of performing “life-saving care.” What is more, the continued insistence that minors possess the maturity and agency to consent to irreversible “gender affirming” medical procedures supports an argument that they likewise possess the capacity to consent to other life-altering decisions. Like having sex with adults. Sometimes, the connections between “gender medicine” and pedophilia are too apparent to ignore. >>> Biden’s “Transgender” Rule Mandating Schools Treat Biological Males as Females Gets Tested In the United Kingdom, for example, Mermaids—an organization billing itself as one of the biggest LGBTQ+ organizations supporting transgender children in the country—is still digging out from its most recent public relations nightmare. A trustee of the charity resigned in October when reports surfaced that he spoke at a conference organized by a group that promotes support for pedophiles. Trans-advocacy has fast become the harbinger for other disorders repackaged in advocacy’s anodyne language. Its precipitous spread now heralds other, irreversible body modifications and noxious cultural trends. Consider what some have called the “next abyss” of body integrity disorder—a condition in which a person \"identifies\" as handicapped. Seeking to exploit the cultural domination of the transgender movement, advocates have reclassified it as “transableism,” for which treatment includes amputation, a snipped spinal cord, blindness. Given current trends, such medical barbarism may also be classified as “life-saving healthcare” soon enough. Once we deny biological reality, the dissolution of moral order follows. When we profess that our eyes are lying about our sexed reality, high-headed notions of consent, capability, or natural law are that much easier to denounce. The trans mind-virus is mutating. The time to find an antidote is now."},

Nothing less.  "], "text": "O’Sullivan’s First Law—named after former National Review editor John O’Sullivan, a one-time speechwriter for then-British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher—states that any institution that’s not explicitly right-wing will become left-wing over time.\n\nThe Walton Family Foundation has proved to be a prime example of that rule. For the past decade or more, second- and third-generation heirs of the Walmart fortune have funneled millions of dollars into LGBTQ+ initiatives in their home state of Arkansas. But the recent decision of a Walton-funded institution suggests the foundation might be pumping the brakes on its slide into woke extremism. The Walton Arts Center in Fayetteville, Arkansas, named after the Walton family for its donations, announced this month that it is no longer hosting drag shows and story hours for kids during the annual LGBTQ+ celebration, Northwest Arkansas Pride. The LGBTQ+ advocacy group Northwest Arkansas Equality, also funded by the Waltons, sponsors that yearly “pride” celebration and the accompanying “Youth Zone” events at the arts center. Among other things, the “Youth Zone” featured drag queen story time for younger kids and drag shows for teens. While it’s not clear what went on behind the scenes in the Walton Arts Center board discussions, it could be that it was some bad publicity that factored into the board’s decision. “Due to the charged nationwide political conversations around drag and minors … , we asked if there was any way we could help NWA Pride reach its intended goals for the Youth Zone without drag performances for minors,” the board of directors explained in a May statement. “Our concern was not simply around the physical safety surrounding these events, but the policy to not allow parents, guardians, and caregivers into the Youth Zone,” it later wrote. That seemed like a reasonable concern, but Northwest Arkansas Equality didn’t think so. The group issued a statement calling the art center’s decision “surprising, disappointing, and inconsistent.” Yeah, not having a drag show for unaccompanied minors is really out of left field. What’s more, the group stated, “These events have included performances by drag celebrities that youth can often only access through television and movies.” Oh, the horror. Kids really should be allowed to witness grown men prancing about in hooker-style costumes in person, preferably without adult supervision. But don’t worry, Northwest Arkansas Equality takes “great care to create age-appropriate content during this event.” Yes, an “age-appropriate” drag show for your child. That’s quite the assurance. The arts center even tried to reach an agreement with Northwest Arkansas Equality. The Walton Arts Center would still host “pride” events in June, just not drag story hours and performances by adults specifically for minors. Northwest Arkansas Equality couldn’t accept any such compromise. The group decided to pause its partnership with the arts center and move its “kid-friendly” drag shows to the Fayetteville Town Center in June. Seems like it got its way, right? Not quite—apparently the Walton Arts Center committed such an egregious offense that a gaggle of protesters showed up May 20 and called for the CEO and other arts center executives to resign. “WAC [Walton Arts Center] is wack. Let the drag queens act,” they chanted. “Say ‘no’ to bigots.” They forgot to add: “Let the drag queens act—in front of your kids.” But then the chant would’ve been less pithy. As of Tuesday, nine of the 22 Walton Arts Center board members resigned as a result of the decision. One such member said that he “cannot in good conscience remain affiliated with an institution which refuses to acknowledge the harm it has caused to members of our community.” The Walton Arts Center’s modest decision not to let drag queens perform in front of kids this year elicited reactions that defy all reason. The outrage is revealing: Those pushing for the “Youth Zone” didn’t care about creating a safe and welcoming environment for kids. The nine board members who have walked out thus far didn’t care. Had they cared, they would have reached some compromise with the arts center. Don’t be fooled: This is about the explicit sexualization of minors. Nothing less. Kudos to the Walton Arts Center for not yielding to this outrage. It’s a small victory, but it offers a glimmer of hope. Maybe the Waltons will put a pause on their entropy. If they keep it up, they might even reverse the fate O’Sullivan’s First Law ordains. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

"], "text": "Just when you thought Virginia’s Loudoun County Public Schools could not get any worse. Now, Biden’s Department of Education has launched an investigation into how the school system handled two 2021 sexual assaults against girls by a boy claiming to be “transgender.” Its investigation of those complaints will force the department to come to terms with the inconsistencies in its own legally suspect expansion of Title IX that mandates biological males claiming to be female be considered the same as biological females under the law. Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972—the federal law that guarantees equal opportunities for girls and women in education—states simply: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” In 2020, under the leadership of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the Department of Education issued a rule clarifying that Title IX’s prohibition against sex discrimination also included a prohibition against sexual harassment and sexual assault. Many guessed that the rule wasn’t destined for survival under the Biden administration, and they were right. In 2021, Biden’s DOE issued a notice of interpretation of Title IX, indicating that, in addition to rescinding the 2020 DeVos rule, it would, going forward, interpret Title IX’s sex discrimination prohibition to also include a prohibition on discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. That interpretation would be applied to all aspects of federally funded education programs—including private, sex-separated spaces like bathrooms. As a consequence of the DOE’s gender-neutral bathroom policy, a biological male student sexually assaulted a female in the women’s bathroom at Stone Bridge High School in Loudoun County. The assailant was later transferred to a different school in the county where he sexually assaulted another female a few months later. The student was ultimately convicted of criminal sexual assault and was ordered to attend a residential treatment facility until the age of 18. After an investigation, a Virginia special grand jury published a report in December 2022 about the school system’s handling of the sexual assaults. The grand jury found that “LCPS [Loudoun County Public Schools] administrators were looking out for their own interests instead of the best interests of LCPS. This invariably led to a stunning lack of openness, transparency, and accountability.” In particular, the grand jury concluded that the superintendent, Scott Ziegler, knew about the first sexual assault but had denied any knowledge of it during a 2021 school board meeting. He was fired shortly after the release of the report. Now, prompted by a complaint from America First Legal Foundation filed with the DOE’s Office for Civil Rights, the department has launched an investigation into the school system to determine if it properly responded to both incidents of sexual assault, as required by Title IX. The school system lacked a proper Title IX complaint process, and it did not begin a Title IX investigation until months after both sexual assaults. It did not even have an official Title IX guidance policy (only a draft policy) until 2022. If the school system had had proper Title IX complaint and investigation procedures in place, it could possibly have prevented the second sexual assault. Title IX is vital to ensure all students—regardless of their sex—receive an equal education. But both victims were denied that opportunity because the school authorities failed to fulfill their duties under federal civil rights law. Complicating matters is the Biden administration’s proposed Title IX rule change that, among other things, would not only cement a gender-neutral bathroom policy in federally funded schools across the country but also eliminate due process protections for those accused of sexual assault and harassment. Removing all the due process protections created by the DeVos 2020 Title IX rule would mean no live hearings, no introduction of evidence, and no opportunity to be represented by counsel, for example. DOE’s proposed rule also brings back the single-investigator model, putting all the power in the hands of one unelected bureaucrat who has the power to change the trajectory of a student’s life with the stroke of a pen. In short, Biden’s rule creates, in essence, a “guilty until proven innocent” presupposition, which has the potential to make Title IX even more difficult to follow and administer. Given the gravity of sexual assault and harassment allegations as an impediment to full and equal educational opportunity, due process protections are important to ensure that accusations are handled seriously and fairly to all parties concerned and that the full truth is uncovered. However, the Loudoun County Public Schools situation points to something else that might stymie the Biden administration’s grand plans to shoehorn the transgender-rights agenda into existing federal law. When employed in the trenches of the school bathroom wars, the final Title IX rule could actually work against itself. Specifically, the rule both presumes the guilt of the accused and the entitlement of biological boys and men who claim to identify as women to use women’s bathrooms, including opportunistic, predatory males who are lying and who really have sexual assault or harassment on their minds. How are schools and colleges going to balance the interest of competing civil rights complaints? If a biological male sexually assaults or harasses a female in a bathroom that’s no longer sex-specific due to the new Title IX rule, and a female files a Title IX complaint—who prevails? According to the Biden administration’s rule, any transgender-identified male is “entitled” to be in that bathroom, but any female is granted the benefit of the doubt in a sexual harassment or assault proceeding. The DOE’s investigation into Loudoun County Public Schools could be nothing more than a performative formality, but time will tell. What we do know is the unfortunate reality that changes to Title IX put students, mostly young girls, in schools across the country at increased risk of sexual assault and harassment, not to mention of violations of their privacy in intimate spaces. What happened in Loudoun County will most certainly not stay in Loudoun County, and we will all be worse off for it. The Biden administration has created a bureaucratic nightmare for school leaders and administrators with its new Title IX rule. After resolution of the Title IX complaint against Loudoun County, we may see just how much of a nightmare it is going to be. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

It is not going to be easy, but the alternative is worse."], "text": "The shocking verbal and physical abuse of swimmer Riley Gaines at the hands of transgender activists and their supporters, after she spoke on April 6 at San Francisco State University (SFSU), is another reminder that America has created a toxic culture where one side, the Left, believes it has the right to violently shut down its opponents. And it increasingly is happening around the issue of transgenderism. Its activists are growing bolder and bolder, and violent, with demands that everyone accept that they can, indeed, change sex by wishing it so. Gaines was at SFSU to speak about being forced to compete against Lia Thomas, a man who says he’s a woman and is therefore allowed to defeat women in swimming competitions. She has become a spokesperson of sorts for the rights of women to be allowed to compete against only other women, therefore showing a degree of courage unmatched by others who decide to stay quiet. And we can see why. >>> Stuff of Parents’ Nightmares: Washington State Bill Hides Runaway Kids From Transgender-“Unsupportive” Parents Demonstrators—organized, according to the New York Post, by SFSU’s Queer and Trans Resource Center—rushed in from outside after her talk and surrounded Gaines. Videos of the mob attacking Gaines flooded social media over the Easter weekend. Gaines was quoted by the Post as saying she was “ambushed and physically hit.” Her husband Louis Barker told Fox News that Gaines was “hit multiple times.” Clips on social media show a mob chasing Gaines as overwhelmed security men tried to protect her. Obscenities such as “you FXXXng transphobic Bxxtch,” can be heard over and over, as well as “You crying? You crying, you fxxxng crying, bxxth? Fax you!” (They don’t seem to have a very extensive vocabulary.) Gaines, a 23-year-old, 12-time All-American champion, may have been physically shaken—she was barricaded for three hours after the mob attack—but she shows no sign of letting up. She tweeted: Sadly, this is only the most recent attack by a mob of leftist students against a speaker with whom they disagreed. Last month, Stuart Kyle Duncan, a judge on the on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, went to speak at Stanford Law School, one of the country’s best law schools. “When I arrived, the walls were festooned with posters denouncing me for crimes against women, gays, blacks and trans people’,” Judge Duncan wrote in the Wall Street Journal on May 17. About 100 protestors awaited him, making noise that could be heard 50 yards away. “As I entered the classroom, one protester screamed: ‘We hope your daughters get raped’!” the judge wrote. (Other witnesses corroborated this account.) The protesters were not there to oppose the subject of Judge Duncan’s talk, which he says was to be on an arcane matter – how circuit courts interact with the Supreme Court. Rather, the judge says, the protesters were there because in his practice, he represents “clients and advanced arguments the protesters hate.” “For instance,” added the judge, he has defended “Louisiana’s traditional marriage laws.” The protesters were also “especially vexed” that one of the hundreds of judicial decisions the judge has written was U.S. v. Varner. In that decision, “a federal prisoner serving a term for attempted receipt of child pornography (and with a previous state conviction for possession of child porn) petitioned our court to order that he be called by feminine pronouns. As my opinion explained, federal courts can’t control what pronouns people use. The Stanford protesters saw it differently: My opinion had ‘denied a transwoman’s existence’.” The treatment they meted out to the judge was, again, despicable. They did not hit him, as Gaines’s protesters hit her. >>> Stanford Law School—EXPOSED But Judge Duncan did have to contend with the added insult (and absurdity) of having a member of Stanford’s staff join the Maoist struggle session against him. Tirien Steinbach, Stanford’s associate dean for diversity, equity and inclusion, had been sitting in the room where Judge Duncan was to speak. She asked the judge if she could speak, and then, rather than defending him, proceeded to pile on. Judge Duncan’s work, she said, felt “abhorrent” and “literally denies the humanity of people.” Steinbach made it sound as though she was working to “create a space of belonging for all people” and reassured him that he was “absolutely welcome in this space.” “I didn’t feel welcome—who would?” wrote the Judge in the Wall Street Journal. Given the circumstances, the judge adjourned his talk and, like Gainer, had to be escorted out. Yes, the President of Stanford and the dean of the Law School did apologize later (better than SFSU has done so far, though their embarrassment happened only hours before this writing). Steinbach has also gone on “administrative leave,” according to Fox News. But the damage has been done. The growing threat that people who see themselves as something other than their biological sex must be addressed by the pronouns of their choice—or else—is, of course, totalitarian. To remain a free society, there is no choice but to resist this extortion. It is not going to be easy, but the alternative is worse."},

Rather, they vote on the entire resolution, including the deadline.", "Both Tuesday’s hearing and the D.C. Circuit Court’s decision show that ERA supporters should...simply “start over.”"], "text": "The Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday held a hearing, “The Equal Rights Amendment: How Congress Can Recognize Ratification and Enshrine Equality in Our Constitution.” But even before the hearing could conclude, a federal appeals court ruling threw a monkey wrench into ERA backers’ bid to revive the long-dead 1972 amendment. Advocates of the ERA want Congress to “recognize ratification” of the ERA that Congress proposed in 1972 even though the states refused to ratify it. The ERA died when its ratification deadline passed with fewer than the requisite three-fourths of the states ratifying it, as stipulated in the Constitution. Article V of the Constitution spells out the amendment process. Votes of two-thirds of both houses of Congress may propose an amendment and specify whether states must ratify it through their legislatures or by state conventions. A proposed amendment becomes part of the Constitution when ratified by 38 states. In March 1972, Congress proposed the following constitutional amendment with a seven-year ratification deadline: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.” When its deadline passed, the ERA had been ratified by 35 states, fewer than the 38 required by the Constitution, and five of them had rescinded their support. As everyone understood at the time, the 1972 ERA died more than 40 years ago. Two issues dominated Tuesday’s hearing: Whether the ERA is still needed and whether Congress has any power to revive the 1972 amendment. On the first point, supporters claimed that it would solve problems such as the “pay gap” between men and women. The issue that no one addressed at the hearing, however, was that the ERA cannot address problems like that. Here’s why. The ERA prohibits denial of equality “on account of sex” by “the United States or by any State.” It applies to government action, not private action. Because sex discrimination in employment is illegal, however, any “pay gap” that exists must result from private, not government, action. ERA supporters, in other words, claim the ERA is needed for problems that it cannot address. In addition to what the ERA cannot do, witnesses identified what it can be used for that most Americans would not support. Jennifer Braceras, director of the Independent Women’s Legal Center, for example, explained that because the ERA itself does not define “sex,” today’s gender ideology activists would push for it to be interpreted to include sexual orientation and gender identity. That, in turn, would threaten policies and programs specifically designed to support women and girls. Braceras was on solid ground there. In hearings that were held before Congress proposed the ERA in 1972, and long before gender ideology was sweeping the country, then-Assistant Attorney General William Rehnquist, who would later become chief justice of the Supreme Court, warned that the ERA could threaten such programs and undermine women’s sports. Braceras also warned that, especially when driven by gender ideology, the ERA could be used to prevent protecting the unborn, mandate taxpayer funding of abortion, or threaten the tax-exempt status of churches that ordain men but not women. ERA advocates long ago said they wanted to use it for such purposes. The other issue at Tuesday’s hearing was the one reflected in its title; namely, whether Congress has any authority to revive the ERA by retroactively removing its ratification deadline. Professor Elizabeth Price Foley, who teaches constitutional law at Florida International University, explained that Congress’ role in the constitutional amendment process ends when it proposes an amendment by passing a joint resolution that includes its text and sends it to the states. She rejected the argument by the amendment’s supporters that the ERA’s ratification deadline was invalid because Congress placed it in the joint resolution’s introductory clause, rather than in the proposed amendment’s text. Foley explained that neither Congress, nor the states, vote only on the amendment’s text. Rather, they vote on the entire resolution, including the deadline. Foley argued that if Congress can, at any time, retroactively change the terms under which constitutional amendments had previously been proposed or ratified, Congress could unilaterally change the Constitution at will. Most of these arguments had been made in previous ERA hearings, and witnesses such as Foley and former Stanford law professor Kathleen Sullivan had testified before. But the surprise of the hearing came when the Judiciary Committee’s ranking member, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., interrupted his own questioning to announce that the U.S. Court of Appeals had just issued a decision regarding the topic of that very hearing. Even though the ERA had died decades earlier, the legislatures of Nevada, Illinois, and Virginia passed what they claimed were ratification resolutions in just the past several years and that thus the magic number of 38 had been reached. When, on advice from the Justice Department, the archivist of the U.S. declined to certify that the ERA had been successfully ratified, those states sued to force him to do so. The U.S. District Court rejected their arguments in 2021, holding that the archivist’s certification was not required for a proposed constitutional amendment to become part of the Constitution. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit heard arguments last September. On Tuesday, in the middle of the Judiciary Committee’s hearing on the issue, the D.C. Circuit unanimously affirmed the district court, refusing to order the archivist to certify the 1972 ERA. Judge Robert Wilkins, appointed by President Barack Obama, wrote the opinion and was joined by Judges Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee; and Michelle Childs, appointed by President Joe Biden. The court emphasized the high legal standard for a court to order an executive branch official, such as the archivist, to take such an action. The states, Wilkins wrote, had not established that their right to such an order was “clear and indisputable.” Significantly, the court also said that the states had cited “no pervasive authority” that Congress may not specify the mode of state ratification in the joint resolution’s introductory clause. If that language can be placed in the introductory clause, Wilkins asked, “then why not also the ratification deadline?” Both Tuesday’s hearing, which retreaded familiar ground, and the D.C. Circuit Court’s decision, which addressed a novel issue, show that ERA supporters should follow the advice of the now-deceased Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and simply “start over.” This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

They’re beating a dead horse. Over the years, more than 1,100 resolutions proposing an Equal Rights Amendment have been introduced in Congress. Only one—House Joint Resolution 208, proposed in 1972—received the two-thirds support needed to be sent to the states. That resolution had a seven-year deadline for ratification. At least 38 states needed to approve the amendment, but, by early 1977, confirmations stopped at 35—and five of those states quickly rescinded their approval. The March 1979 deadline passed without additional approvals, as did an extended deadline Congress tried to set. As the Congressional Research Services puts it, the ERA “formally died on June 30, 1982.” Pretending otherwise makes a mockery of the legislative process. >>> Not Your Grandmother’s ERA: Why Current Equal Rights Amendment Strategies Will Fail But that hasn’t stopped some lawmakers. In March 2021, the House narrowly passed a resolution purporting to remove the 1972 ERA’s ratification deadline. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) has now introduced a similar measure, Senate Joint Resolution 4. The 1972 ERA’s deadline, however, was valid and binding. When it failed in the states, it died. It is no longer pending before the states to be ratified, and no longer pending before Congress to be amended. It no longer exists. The Supreme Court has held that Congress’s authority to propose constitutional amendments includes the power “to fix a definite period for the ratification.” Congress has done so many times. Eight amendments currently in the Constitution were ratified under a seven-year deadline, and nearly 60 resolutions to propose the ERA, including Resolution 208, have deadlines. Everyone, from Rep. Martha Griffiths (D-Mich.), who introduced the 1972 ERA, to the women’s groups promoting it supported including a ratification deadline and understood that it was valid and binding. In fact, that is the only reason they pushed to extend the deadline. Congress proposes a constitutional amendment by adopting a joint resolution containing two parts: an introductory clause and the text of the proposed amendment. A ratification deadline can appear in either location. Looking at the Constitution, the deadline set for Amendments 18 and 20 through 22 appears in the text while the deadline for Amendments 23 through 26 appears in the introductory clause. It’s unlikely that Congress will ever muster two-thirds support for another ERA resolution, so supporters are desperate to give the impression that the 1972 ERA is at least on life support. Thus, they now claim that a ratification deadline is valid only if it appears in the text, not if it comes a few inches up the page in the introductory clause. It just so happens that Resolution 208’s deadline was in the introductory clause, and so, they proclaim, it’s still alive. This mischaracterizes, or perhaps misunderstands, both how Congress proposes constitutional amendments and how states ratify them. Congress does not vote on the amendment text in isolation, but on a resolution that includes that text, and sends that resolution to the states. Congress actually considered where to put a ratification deadline, the consensus finding the introductory clause more suitable for a very practical reason. Since a deadline is not important after an amendment is finally ratified, keeping it out of the amendment’s text helps avoid cluttering up the Constitution. Congress attributed no more significance to a deadline’s location than that. >>> How Courts Would Use the Equal Rights Amendment to Ruin the Country In at least 25 states, the legislature ratified the 1972 ERA by adopting a resolution that quoted Resolution 208 in its entirety, including the introductory clause and the ratification deadline. Other states made specific reference to the deadline during the ratification process. Congress knew when proposing, and the states knew when ratifying, that the deadline was valid and binding. Congress has the authority to set one, and its relative placement in a proposing resolution has no relevance whatsoever. The unavoidable conclusion is that the 1972 ERA died no later than June 30, 1982. Like a resolution that expires when the Congress in which it was introduced adjourns, the 1972 ERA expired when its deadline passed with fewer state ratifications than the Constitution requires. Pretending that Congress has the power to extend the time limit for a failed constitutional amendment that has not existed for more than 40 years is absurd. ERA supporters should instead follow the advice of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. As a law professor in 1977, Ginsburg drafted a report for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights acknowledging that the 1972 ERA could become part of the Constitution only if ratified within its original seven-year deadline. Forty-three years later, as a justice, Ginsburg said that ERA supporters should “start over.”"},

Ratifications stopped in January 1977 at 35 (five of them quickly rescinded), three shy of the 38 the Constitution requires. Rather than make absurd arguments that the ERA was really only hibernating, advocates today should follow then-Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg’s 2020 advice and “start over.” Afraid that they would fall short by the March 1979 deadline, ERA supporters in 1978 pushed Congress to pass a resolution purporting to extend the deadline to June 30, 1982. The only court to address it found this extension unconstitutional, in part because it passed Congress with less than the two-thirds majority the Constitution requires for proposing constitutional amendments. >>> The ERA Has Just One Purpose Left: Abortion The only reason to attempt an extension at all was that the original deadline was both looming and binding. In fact, shortly after the extended deadline passed with no new ratifications, acting Solicitor General Lawrence G. Wallace wrote in a memo that the ERA “had failed of adoption” because fewer than 38 states ratified it before either the original or the extended deadline. Even the National Organization for Women conceded defeat, The Washington Post reported. And as the Congressional Research Service has concluded multiple times, the 1972 ERA “died on June 30, 1982.” Was Michigan Democratic Rep. Martha Griffiths, the 1972 ERA’s own sponsor, wrong when she agreed to add a binding seven-year deadline to gain further support? Was Rep. Elizabeth Holtzman, New York Democrat, wrong to introduce the deadline extension resolution because the original deadline was binding? Were the U.S. District Court, acting solicitor general, and Congressional Research Service all wrong that the 35 ratifying states fell short when the deadlines passed? Virginia Deputy Attorney General Walter S. Felton Jr. said in 1994 that “the ERA was not currently before the states for ratification because its original and extended time limits had expired.” Even National Public Radio has reported that the 1972 ERA “fell short and expired in 1982.” Were they all wrong? No. What did they all miss? Nothing. The current claim that the ERA was only “mostly dead” all those years balances on an exceptionally slim reed. The argument is that the ratification deadline in House Joint Resolution 208, which Congress passed in March 1972, appears not in the text of the proposed ERA but a few inches up the page in the resolutions’ introductory clause. Yup, that’s it. Here’s one of many problems with this weak argument. Article V of the Constitution gives Congress two powers related to constitutional amendments. The Supreme Court has held that Congress’ power to propose constitutional amendments includes the power to set ratification deadlines. Article V also gives Congress the power to dictate whether ratification must be made “by the Legislatures of three fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three fourths thereof.” Congress has always provided for the mode of ratification the proposing resolution’s introductory clause, never in the text of the proposed amendment. >>> The New ERA Is Even Worse Than the Original If a ratification deadline in the introductory clause is invalid, then so is a mode of ratification designation. States would be free to disregard Congress’ instruction and ratify a proposed amendment by any method they choose. ERA supporters cannot have it both ways, and so they must come up with an answer to this obvious implication of their argument. In January 2021, Sen. Ben Cardin, Maryland Democrat, introduced Senate Joint Resolution 1, purportedly to remove the ratification deadline in the 1972 ERA. The deadline extension resolution in 1978, as contentious as it was, was at least passed before the original March 1979 expiration date. The 1972 ERA was at least still pending before the states. But Congress cannot amend or change a legislative measure that has not existed for more than 40 years. Mr. Cardin has introduced a similar resolution, Senate Joint Resolution 4, which is even more problematic. Rather than saying that “whenever ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States,” it argues that the 1972 ERA has actually “been ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States.” Even if the 1972 ERA were still alive, Congress has no power to determine whether a proposed constitutional amendment has been ratified. Congress’ power to set a ratification deadline, not where on the page Congress chooses to put it, determines whether the deadline is valid. The 1972 ERA died no later than June 30, 1982. Everyone knew it then, and ERA advocates should accept it now."},

Steinem said what everyone knew: The ERA proposed by Congress in 1972 had expired. ERA supporters today, however, claim that Steinem was wrong—that the 1972 ERA is not only still alive, but that Congress can put it in the Constitution simply by recognizing its ratification. Wrong. Steinem was right: The 1972 ERA is dead. Article V of the Constitution gives Congress the power to propose constitutional amendments and to require that states ratify them either through their legislatures or by conventions. The Supreme Court unanimously held more than a century ago that this power includes setting a ratification deadline, a step Congress has taken many times. Representative Martha Griffiths (D., Mich.), the 1972 ERA’s sponsor, agreed to add a seven-year ratification deadline that she said was “customary,” “perfectly proper,” and could help achieve “united support for the amendment.” Even though the deadline was binding, Griffiths predicted that the necessary three-fourths of the states would ratify the 1972 ERA “in record time.” >>> The Equal Rights Amendment Died Over 40 Years Ago. Democrats Are Trying To Raise It From the Dead. Griffiths was wrong. Five of the 35 states ratifying the 1972 ERA had already withdrawn their support when Indiana became the last ratifying state in January 1977. Knowing that the March 1979 deadline was binding, ERA supporters pushed a 39-month deadline extension through Congress, but no additional states got on board. The Washington Post reported at the time that die-hard supporters such as the National Organization for Women “concede[d] defeat” when the deadline passed with insufficient state support. During the extended ten-year proposal and ratification process, not a single member of either house of Congress or any state legislature questioned whether the 1972 ERA’s ratification deadline was binding. In fact, the ratification resolution adopted in 25 of the 35 ratifying states included the deadline as well as the proposed amendment text. Even the liberal National Public Radio acknowledged just a few years ago that the 1972 ERA “fell short and expired in 1982.” Just two weeks later, Peter Rodino (D., N.J.) then the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, introduced another resolution to propose the ERA, starting the process over. That resolution, and the ones he introduced at the start of the 98th and 99th Congress, also had a seven-year ratification deadline. So did the resolution that Representative Don Edwards (D., Calif.) introduced in the late ’80s and early ’90s. During the same period, Senator Ted Kennedy (D., Mass.) introduced several resolutions to propose the ERA with a seven-year deadline. ERA supporters today, however, say that all of those federal and state legislators, activists, and media outlets were wrong. Every one of them. The 1972 ERA, they now insist, isn’t dead because the deadline didn’t mean what it said and wasn’t really valid after all. Not only that, but Congress can put the 1972 ERA—the one that the Congressional Research Service says “died on June 30, 1982”—in the Constitution simply by “recognizing” its final ratification. Who knew? Trying to keep this myth alive, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on February 28 called “The Equal Rights Amendment: How Congress Can Recognize Ratification and Enshrine Equality in Our Constitution.” It examined Senate Joint Resolution 4, which purported to remove the ratification deadline from the 1972 ERA and to declare that it has, in fact, “been ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States.” This position has two fundamental problems. First, a proposed constitutional amendment is no longer pending when it has been ratified by three-fourths of the states or when its ratification deadline passes without reaching that threshold, whichever comes first. In the case of the 1972 ERA, the deadline passed first and, even counting the states that had already changed their minds, 35 is less than 38. The 1972 ERA, therefore, is no longer pending before the states to be ratified and no longer pending before Congress to be amended. This is Legislative Process 101. Every bill or resolution introduced during the previous 117th Congress that was not acted on expires when that Congress adjourns. Griffiths, for example, did not attempt to add a ratification deadline to the ERA resolutions she introduced in the previous six congresses because those no longer existed. Instead, she introduced a new resolution, this time with a deadline, to start the proposal process over again. >>> The ERA Has Just One Purpose Left: Abortion The second problem is that Article V of the Constitution, which Judiciary Committee members themselves swore to support and defend, gives Congress no power after it proposes an amendment. Even liberal constitutional scholars, whom Democrats typically favor, recognize what is plain on the face of Article V. Walter Dellinger, the late professor and former acting solicitor general, for example, wrote that Article V “requires no additional action by Congress or by anyone else after ratification by the final state. The creation of a ‘third step’—promulgation by Congress—has no foundation in the text of the Constitution.” The Senate, the House, or the two acting together can, of course, express an opinion about whether a proposed amendment has been fully ratified, but that’s as far as these bodies can go. Proposed amendments become part of the Constitution automatically upon ratification by three-fourths of the states; there exists no such thing as congressional “recognition” of ratification. The desperation of ERA supporters is understandable because the 1972 ERA was likely the only one that Congress will ever propose. It has all sorts of symbolic value, and activists no doubt have big plans for it; the Supreme Court overruling its decisions creating a right to abortion, for example, has renewed the argument that the ERA could provide a separate constitutional foundation for abortion rights. But the 1972 ERA train has not only left the station, it derailed more than four decades ago. ERA supporters should follow the advice of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and “start over.”"},

Supporters should, as Ginsburg urged them, “start over.”"], "text": "The Senate Judiciary Committee will hold an unusual hearing on February 28 titled, “The Equal Rights Amendment: How Congress Can Recognize Ratification and Enshrine Equality in Our Constitution.” It’s unusual because it focuses on a power that Congress doesn’t possess and a proposed amendment that doesn’t exist. Article V of the Constitution gives Congress the power, “whenever two thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary,” to propose constitutional amendments and to require that states ratify them either through their legislatures or by conventions. The Supreme Court has held that the power to propose amendments includes setting a “reasonable” ratification deadline. A proposed amendment becomes part of the Constitution “when ratified by . . . three fourths of the several States,” which today means 38 states. A proposed constitutional amendment without a ratification deadline, therefore, is pending until it is ratified by three-fourths of the states in the manner Congress has prescribed. The states ratified 19 of the 23 amendments that Congress proposed without a deadline, and the other four remain pending. A proposed amendment with a deadline is pending until it is ratified by three-fourths of the states or its ratification deadline passes with insufficient state support, whichever comes first. The states ratified eight of the ten amendments that Congress proposed with a deadline, and the other two have expired. The Congressional Research Service’s extensive treatise on the Constitution includes the ERA in its section on “Proposed Amendments Not Ratified by the States,” noting that it “formally died” when its deadline passed with fewer than 38 ratifying states. >>> Appeals Court Steals Show on ERA Amid Senate Panel’s Bid to Resurrect Dead Amendment The Justice Department, during administrations of both parties, has confirmed this fact. A February 1977 opinion by the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) stated that, “The Equal Rights Amendment must be approved within 7 years after its submission to the States.” That, of course, did not happen. A January 2020 OLC opinion concluded that, “Congress had the constitutional authority to impose a deadline on the ratification of the ERA and, because that deadline has expired, the [1972 ERA] is no longer pending before the States.” In Idaho v. Freeman, the only court to address the issue found Congress’s attempt to extend the 1972 ERA’s ratification deadline to be unconstitutional. While ERA supporters are quick to point out that the Supreme Court vacated the decision in Freeman, they avoid the basis for the court’s decision. In July 1982, several months after the ruling, acting solicitor general Lawrence G. Wallace wrote a memo for the head of the General Services Administration explaining that the Freeman case was moot because the 1972 ERA had “expired” and “failed of adoption.” The Supreme Court agreed, vacating the district court’s decision as moot “[u]pon consideration of the memorandum for the Administrator of General Services.” Which brings us to the February 28 Judiciary Committee hearing. The committee will hear from Senators Ben Cardin (D., Md.) and Lisa Murkowski (R., Ark.), sponsors of Senate Joint Resolution 4, which purports to remove the 1972 ERA’s ratification deadline and to declare that it has been ratified by the necessary 38 states. Since Congress has no power or role in the constitutional-amendment process after proposing an amendment, however, nothing it does—including passing a measure such as this one—can have any effect whatsoever on whether a proposed amendment actually becomes part of the Constitution. >>> Want to Protect Life? Oppose Revival of the Equal Rights Amendment Even if it could, this is funny math even for Congress. Five of the 35 states that ratified the 1972 ERA rescinded their approval before the March 1979 deadline: Thirty-five minus five equals 30, which is fewer than 38. Three of the states that ERA supporters want to count passed ratification resolutions more than 40 years after the ratification deadline. Even if you were to count them, despite the untimeliness of their approval, 30 plus three equals 33, and 33 is still less than 38. The late justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was one of the ERA’s strongest supporters. In 2020 remarks, however, she asked whether, “If you count a latecomer [state] on the plus side, how can you disregard states that said ‘we’ve changed our minds’?” No matter how you cut it, the 1972 ERA is long dead, and Congress has no power to revive it. Supporters should, as Ginsburg urged them, “start over.”"},

Many of the activists at this feminist fest seem confused about who women are and what they need. Two dangerous ideas are at play at CSW. First, ideologues seek to displace “sex” with an amorphous notion of “gender identity,” which is independent of the body. In their view, anyone can identify as—and ipso facto be—a woman. Second, they pit women’s empowerment against a basic biological aspect of what it means to be a woman—the capacity to conceive and bear a child. Together, these related ideas are a two-pronged, frontal assault on the dignity of women. The governments driving the agenda at CSW are from the West; leading the way are the U.S., European Union, and Nordic countries. These countries contribute the most funding to U.N. agencies and programs, which lends their voices extra weight. They are pushing for a CSW outcome document that reflects this sexual agenda. This would be another step toward their goal of giving the U.N. system itself a mandate to promote abortion and gender ideology. The outcome document under negotiation is replete with euphemisms. “Sexual and reproductive health” is used to encompass “safe abortion.” “Comprehensive information about sexual and reproductive health” is the new lingo for “comprehensive sexuality education.” (That term has been exposed as containing explicit sexual material.) Newer phrases such as “multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination” are supposed to be more palatable to critics of “sexual orientation and gender identity.” But these are just new words to disguise the same old agenda. >>> Yes, Baby Girls Who Are “Unwanted” Because of Their Sex Are Aborted in America Don’t expect the U.S. government to object. Under President Joe Biden, it has gone all-in on gender ideology. The State Department recently honored a man who masquerades as a woman with the International Women of Courage Award. In public, U.S. officials use popular language about “women and girls” and “gender equality.” But in closed negotiations, they press for “women in all their diversity” and refer to “gender equity.” These terms are much less popular—both at home and abroad. The Left often disguises its support for gender ideology, but it makes no secret of its advocacy of abortion. In her national statement to the commission, U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield referred to the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. “I have traveled the globe advocating for women’s rights,” she said, “and it pains me to know that so many in my own country want to undo fundamental rights.” In fact, abortion is not a fundamental right, nor is it guaranteed by any international human rights treaty. But abortion advocates such as Thomas-Greenfield gloss over that crucial detail. At the opening of the CSW, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that “women’s sexual and reproductive rights are being rolled back.” He urged delegates to “push back against the pushback on women’s rights.” >>> Biological Males in Women’s Sports Guarantees Unfair Outcomes For years, abortion proponents at the U.N. have been talking about “pushing back against the pushback” to their gender goals. Last week, the Nordic countries hosted an event titled “Pushing back the pushback” and handed out tote bags to attendees emblazoned with that slogan. The speakers railed against “toxic masculinity” and called for upending “the patriarchy.” The sexual Left may seem to be everywhere. But its opponents—whom it calls “the pushback”—are the quiet majority. While lacking the resources and clout of Europe and the U.S., most countries in the world are pro-life and pro-family. They value religious belief and tradition. They want solutions that respect the unique differences and capabilities of women and girls. Gender and abortion activists, in contrast, seek to erase biology from womanhood and motherhood. These goals serve neither women nor girls. As the commission comes to a close this week, delegates should reject both prongs of the sex agenda of the West. It doesn’t represent the globe, and it shouldn’t represent the U.S. and its allies."},

", "Here’s the good news: there are several ways to define sex precisely. It just takes some work.", "Current efforts to redefine sex to include “gender identity” would dissolve sex as a stable legal category and create legal chaos."], "text": "Until recently, no precise legal definition of sex—and especially the terms “male” and “female”—was needed because no one contested it. Unfortunately, because of gender ideology’s growing influence on our laws and institutions, states no longer have this luxury. Gender activists are now working to redefine sex in federal laws and regulations, such as Title IX, to include “gender identity.” If this succeeds, it will subvert all preexisting legal references to sex, contrary to their original intent. Some state legislators are proposing to define sex by tying it to biology, but in an artfully vague or general way, in order to distinguish it from “gender.” Here’s a common formulation that appears in bills dealing with pediatric gender medicine: It’s not clear why the term is being defined as “biological sex” rather than “sex” simply.  After all, the purpose of the definition is to tie sex to biology, so the qualifier “biological” is redundant. More to the point, this definition provides no explanation of the difference between males and females. As a result, it’s not likely to do much good in cases where that difference is at issue. Recognizing this problem, some states have begun to propose legislation to define these terms in state law. Montana is currently debating one such law, SB 458 (2023). To see why this needs to be done, we must understand what gender ideology is and the confusion that it creates. What Is Gender Ideology? Gender ideology’s intellectual pedigree is complex. For our purposes, however, we can focus on its orthodox formulation in school curricula, popular culture, and medicine. In this form, it displaces the sexual binary of male and female—which describes all mammals including humans—with two subjective notions: First, an internal sense of gender called “gender identity” that is distinct from, and can even be in discord with, the body; and second, mere “sex assigned at birth.” >>> Gender Ideology and the Future of the Human Person Hence, its most ardent champions do not refer to a person’s sex when defining their terms. The Ontario Human Rights Commission is representative. “Gender identity,” the commission explains, “is each person’s internal and individual experience of gender. It is a person’s sense of being a woman, a man, both, neither, or anywhere along the gender spectrum.” Note that the same word appears in both the definition and the word being defined. That circularity is a philosophical necessity because gender ideology detaches gender identity from biological sex. This way of speaking and thinking is the essence of gender ideology. Efforts to redefine terms such as sex to comport with the lexicon of gender ideology threaten many important social goods. To preserve these goods, states need to anchor their legal definitions of sex, and related terms such as “male” and “female,” in the solid ground of biological facts. A Campaign of Confusion The main way gender ideologues have confused the public is by falsely claiming that disorders of sexual development, often mislabeled “intersex” conditions, prove that there are more than two sexes—or that the sexes are somehow fluid or mere endpoints on a spectrum. Such disorders occur in 0.018 percent of the population. In some such cases, however, newborns have ambiguous genitalia. This makes the task of determining sex more complex. Nevertheless, appealing to these disorders to justify gender ideology is an intentional diversion. First, none of these conditions produces other sexes or “genders.” Second, gender ideology provides no new insights into these disorders. Third, people who identify as transgender or nonbinary rarely have one of these disorders. And fourth, no such disorders correspond to the growing list of “gender identities.” Defining Sex Imprecisely Unfortunately, some who seek to defend the reality of sex—that is, the sexual binary—offer hasty and imprecise definitions, which can serve to discredit their efforts. A bill might claim, for instance, that all humans are either male or female and have either XX or XY chromosomes—corresponding to females (XX) and males (XY). But, as noted above, there are rare chromosomal disorders where this doesn’t hold. If the wording of the law fails to account for people with these disorders, it provides a target for critics to torpedo the legislation. The same sort of problem arises with some common ways of defining the two sexes. One might say, for instance, that “a woman can have babies; a man can’t.” That’s true—but it’s not a definition of “man” or “woman.” After all, some women have had hysterectomies, or have gone through menopause. Do they not count as women? Of course they do. So much the worse for the definition. Now, everyone intuits that the difference between men and women has something to do with the ability to have babies. And there are ways to state the intuition precisely. For instance, to speak in the argot of “set theory,” you can say that the set of people who can have babies is a proper subset of the set of women. The set of all men, in contrast, contains no subset that can have babies. And if you remember high school biology, you know that XX and XY chromosomes have something to do with sex. But biology is complex, and definitions are hard to get just right. Set theory or chromosomes might help us understand the difference between males and females, but as a matter of law these definitions are not precise enough. Vague legal definitions create openings for gender ideology to gain a toehold. Defining Sex Precisely Here’s the good news: there are several ways to define sex precisely. It just takes some work. Any good definition will capture the central concept of biological sex—the orientation of male and female bodies for reproduction. It will also refer to what happens under normal development while accounting for disorders. Finally, it will accommodate the fact that organisms have and do different things at different stages of development. For instance, a female human embryo does not menstruate or get pregnant—nor does a woman who has passed through menopause. A male embryo very early in development does not (yet) have a penis or testes. The definitions provided in Montana’s SB 458, for instance, account for both disorders and development. A human male is, minimally, a member of the human species who, under normal development, produces relatively small, mobile gametes—sperm—at some point in his life cycle, and has a reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of that gamete. A human female is, minimally, a member of the human species who, under normal development, produces relatively large, relatively immobile gametes—ova—at some point in her life cycle, and has a reproductive and endocrine system oriented around the production of that gamete. The phrase “under normal development” does a great deal of work in these definitions. We grasp the existence of distinct animal taxa (species, genera, families, classes, etc.) intuitively. “Human” refers to our species (Homo sapiens). We also distinguish abnormal from normal development without much effort. For instance, we know that humans are bipeds—that they naturally have two legs. But if a child is born without one or both legs, do we conclude that the newborn isn’t human, is a member of another species, or is “interspecies”? Of course not. We recognize that the child suffers from some sort of disorder—some disruption in development involving, say, chromosomes or an event in utero. Note that we’re engaged in counterfactual reasoning. We infer that the newborn would have had two legs except for some event or abnormality that prevented this from happening. We can learn to reason this way over time if we encounter enough organisms to discern the basic pattern, or if we study biology. For most adults, this way of thinking is common sense, or what philosopher Michael Polanyi called “tacit knowledge.” That is, we understand the basic contours of sex and how it works in the world, even if we have a hard time explaining the chain of reasoning and definitions involved. Normal vs. Abnormal Development Some might claim that the distinction between “normal” and “abnormal” is prejudicial, or that it represents an incursion of sectarian philosophy into science. This is false. One might view these categories, say, in terms of natures conceived along Aristotelian lines. Others may understand the distinction statistically, in terms of sexual selection, through a combination of these views, or in some other way. But whatever one’s philosophical or theoretical framework, it’s impossible to get very far in describing biological reality without relying on the distinction between normal and abnormal. This is true whether one is a rancher with only a high-school education, a physician with an MD, or a developmental biologist with a PhD. >>> “Gender,” Marxism, and the Search for Power Is it special pleading to appeal to what is “normal” for disorders of sexual development? Not at all. It’s how we understand function and development in all organisms—including sex. We know from observation, analysis, and well-confirmed theory that humans are mammals (class: Mammalia), and that sex in mammals is binary. That means there are two and only two types of gametes and corresponding body structures. One of each gamete is needed for reproduction. Moreover, under normal development in all placental mammals, including humans, a male has XY chromosomes, and he will develop and at some point have testes, a prostate, and a penis. A female, under normal development, has XX chromosomes, and she will develop and at some point have a uterus, ovaries, a cervix, and a vagina. Barring a disorder or disruption, a female can carry, give birth to, and nurse offspring at some point during her life cycle. A male cannot. Males and females also differ in the prevalence of hormones such as testosterone and estrogen, respectively, and develop distinct secondary anatomical differences under the influence of these hormones, especially during puberty. This is why, in almost all cases, the presence of such features is sufficient to conclude that a newborn is either male or female. Sex in almost all cases is easily observed, not “assigned.” But what about the rare exceptions? What happens if a newborn lacks some secondary sex characteristic—such as a penis—or has ambiguous genitalia, or is found (using much more recent techniques) to have a chromosomal anomaly? As mentioned above, we would not, and should not, conclude that the child is not a human, or has no sex, or is some third sex. In most cases, we can with a bit more investigation determine that the child is male or female, and so would have the usual features of that sex except for a disorder that disrupted normal development. Even if we could not determine the sex of an individual, we would treat this as an epistemic limit. We would not, or at least should not, treat such a person as a member of a third sex, or of no sex. And even if one were inclined to do that in such rare cases, this would do nothing to establish the many exotic claims and implications of gender ideology. For instance, it would provide no basis for the claim that a developmentally normal male could be a female simply by identifying as one. A transgender or nonbinary gender identity is not the same thing as various disorders of sexual development. In fact, we understand such disorders by reference to normal sexual development. In sum, current efforts to redefine sex to include “gender identity” would dissolve sex as a stable legal category and create legal chaos. In response, public institutions must shore up their defenses. One key way to do that is by defining sex—including male and female—precisely in law."},

Parents, legislators, and educators across the country are navigating a complex morass of state and federal laws and regulations. But a federal judge in West Virginia delivered some good news on the definition of “sex” last week. In another stinging defeat for the Biden administration’s woke agenda and its purveyors at the American Civil Liberties Union, U.S. District Judge Joseph Goodwin granted summary judgment (judgment entered by a court for one party and against another without a full trial) to the state of West Virginia on Friday on its Save Women’s Sports bill in B.P.J. v. W. Va. State Bd. of Ed. >>> Safeguarding Parental Rights and Protecting Children from Federally Mandated Gender Ideology Under the law, all biological males—including those who identify as transgender “girls”—are ineligible for participation on girls sports teams. The ACLU and its West Virginia chapter had filed the lawsuit in 2021 on behalf of an 11-year-old transgender girl—a biological boy—who had hoped to compete in middle school cross-country in Harrison County. The question before the court was whether the legislature’s chosen definition of “girl” and “woman” in its sports law was constitutionally permissible. The judge found that it was. “While some females may be able to outperform some males, it is generally accepted that, on average, males outperform females athletically because of inherent physical differences between the sexes,” Goodwin wrote. As the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did in Adams v. School Board of St. Johns County, Goodwin used an “intermediate” standard of review. The Supreme Court has prescribed this standard for legislative distinctions that are based on biological sex; it is lower than “strict scrutiny,” which almost always results in a law being invalidated, but higher than “rational basis,” which nearly always results in a law being upheld. To satisfy intermediate scrutiny, the sports law had to (1) advance an important governmental objective; and (2) be substantially related to that objective. The ACLU argued that when it passed the sports law, the legislature acted with the intention of discriminating against transgender children. Goodwin rejected that argument and concluded that “[t]he legislature’s definition of ‘girl’ as being based on ‘biological sex’ is substantially related to the important government interest of providing equal athletic opportunities for females.” Goodwin also rejected the plaintiff’s claim that the state law violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, a 50-year-old civil rights law that prevents discrimination in education on the basis of sex, which feminists of the day considered a triumph. Goodwin described what the ACLU had to prove in order to succeed: Goodwin concluded that the ACLU failed to meet that burden, and that while Title IX does not define “sex,” the term as used in that law was in the biological sense, because its very purpose was to promote equality between the sexes. Goodwin noted that transgender girls are biologically male, and that biological males were not being excluded from school sports. Rather, they could always try out for the boys teams, regardless of how they expressed their gender identity. Recognizing that the administration’s attempts to redefine sex are suffering some notable legal defeats, the U.S. Department of Education recently issued a notice of proposed rule-making in the Federal Register, indicating that it intends to make a new rule on Title IX. That rule, however, in contrast to the Title IX rule announced last summer (which, as I’ve written, is full of errors), will deal only with transgender participation in school sports. And while the Education Department has indicated it intends to publish the Title IX sports rule this May, the sports issue was already a part of the previous rule it proposed. >>> Federal Appeals Court Upholds Florida’s Transgender Bathroom Ban. Now What? It’s no wonder the dialogue on trans athletes in scholastic sports has intensified. Most readers will be familiar with the story of Lia Thomas, the University of Pennsylvania swimmer who represents himself to be female and stole the NCAA Division I Championship last March from his closest female competitor. Now, Iszak Henig, a transgender male (biological female) has joined Yale’s men’s swimming team after concluding last year’s season as an All-American swimmer on the women’s team. Henig has taken hormones for eight months. In a recent meet in November, she finished (some might argue, predictably) in 79th place out of 83 swimmers. Only time will tell whether the U.S. Supreme Court will choose to get involved and resolve the question of whether “sex” within the education context means biological distinctions between males and females. With a split among two federal circuits on the same constitutional and statutory questions on “sex” (one in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and one in the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, as I’ve written about here), the high court has an opportunity to resolve the issue once and for all.

Reps. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) and Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) did, and with good reason. At a time when inflation has forced belt-tightening in households across America, the State Department has seen fit to give a cultural center in Ecuador $20,600 to host “drag theater performances,” with the goal to “promote diversity and inclusion.” Biden’s State Department has supported programs, hoisted flags, and granted money all over the world in furtherance of its leftist social agenda. U.S. foreign aid, too, is increasingly tied to implementing this radical political agenda rather than alleviating global poverty. State-Supported The concerted effort to “queer” U.S. foreign policy is unprecedented. >>> Safeguarding Parental Rights and Protecting Children from Federally Mandated Gender Ideology The leftist political appointees now in charge at State and USAID are funding programs and cultural events that vast swathes of the American public find objectionable. While the State Department blithely funds drag shows in Ecuador, the issue is hotly debated here at home. In Taylor, Texas, for example, town officials voted to stop supporting the traditional Christmas parade, organized by religious ministers. Instead, they’re sponsoring a second parade so the town can accommodate a float featuring drag queens. It’s difficult to understand how such a display—featuring performer “Sedonya Face”—is appropriate for a family Christmas parade. Drag Goes Back Ages Drag has a long history in mainstream comedy. Benny Hill and the Monty Python show used it as part of their acts more than fifty years ago. But like with Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire, the joke was seeing middle-aged men dressed up as frumpy old women. Today, the type of drag to which progressives want to expose children is more burlesque, with risqué costumes, erotic dancing for tips, and stage names with X-rated double meanings. Do we really need to sexualize Christmas “for the kids”? Drag Story Time Drag queen story hour has become a cause célèbre among progressive activists, but the arguments against spending public money to bring drag performers into libraries are simple. First, while it’s great to see adults volunteer to read to children, there is no reason for them to be dressed in caricature, sexualized costumes. This adds nothing to the learning or literary experience for the children and may distract them from the works being read. Second, the books chosen are often selected not on literary merit, but because they promote gender ideology. Promoting any political, religious, or sexual ideology in a taxpayer-funded library seems unnecessary—especially since there are so many great children’s books to read that touch on themes more in keeping with childhood. What, then, is the argument supporting having grown men aping women, instead of normally dressed adults of any orientation, read aloud to kids? Surely hearing stories from drag queens, instead of librarians, parents, or teachers, does not make children better readers. It may show them how diverse human expression in presentation and dress can be, but is it the goal of progressives to show young children the entire variety of behavior (for example, bondage, kink) that humans engage in? Introduction to adult concepts needs to wait until it is age-appropriate. Parents are understandably outraged when they hear of schools attempting to foist sexual content on children too young to understand. >>> West Virginia Wins Day on Fairness in Women’s Sports but Plot Thickens on Title IX Pronoun Agreement Most people involved in the debates on values, particularly as they affect children, are motivated by the desire to protect the vulnerable. A divide has been created in American society, however, over the different ways we want to do it. Many progressives seem to have bought the far-left narrative that conservative parents are bigots, homophobes, and transphobes, who must be embarrassed. They push the envelope for that reason, for example by forcing teachers to use pronouns that they know to be grammatically and factually at odds with the person being addressed. For conservatives, it appears as if the entire point of “drag queen story hour” and various sex and gender programs targeting elementary and even pre-schools is to expose children to—and normalize—lifestyles and practices that their parents would object to and that schools have no business advocating. This is the “praxis” of queer theory, the aim of which is the elimination of traditional morals and the universal acceptance of individual, selfish, solipsism beyond legal or moral challenge. Gender ideology is politically divisive because it is part of a well-thought-out strategy by ideologues to make ordinary Americans embrace falsehoods, like that people can be born in the wrong body; that children can’t express their identity any way they want without needing their “gender” corrected; or that anyone can really ‘transition’ through drugs or surgery to the opposite sex. This dogma is wrong, divisive, and should have no place in U.S. foreign policy."},

Wade will not stop abortion advocates from attacking legal protection for the unborn. They will, however, have to do so state-by-state.", "Decisions like this, with many more to follow, identify opportunities for pro-life citizens to stand up for the unborn.", "These decisions show that while judges will continue to have a prominent role as decisionmakers, citizens can have significant influence."], "text": "Two recent court decisions, on abortion and gender identity, not only demonstrate that judges are in the middle of the cultural fray but also point out where people concerned about these issues must focus. Abortion. Last year, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court held that “the authority to regulate abortion must be returned to the people and their elected representatives.” The Court had removed that authority in Roe v. Wade by inventing a constitutional right to abortion and, nearly 50 years later, corrected that error in Dobbs by overruling Roe. Overruling Roe v. Wade, however, will not stop abortion advocates from attacking legal protection for the unborn. They will, however, have to do so state-by-state, where the legal landscape, including state constitutions and state supreme courts interpreting them, is much more diverse. In 2021, the South Carolina legislature enacted a law prohibiting most abortions after approximately six weeks of pregnancy, when a fetal heartbeat can be detected. Planned Parenthood and two abortionists challenged the law, arguing that the violated Article I, Section 10, of the South Carolina Constitution. This provision reads: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures and unreasonable invasions of privacy shall not be violated.” >>> The Attack on Legal Protection for the Unborn Moves to State Courts Some state constitutions protect privacy without mentioning any particular context. The Alaska Constitution, for example, provides simply that “the right of the people to privacy is recognized and shall not be infringed.” The South Carolina provision appears to treat privacy more narrowly by connecting to the language of “searches and seizures” that echoes the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment. Nonetheless, on Jan. 5, the South Carolina Supreme Court voted 3-2 that the abortion ban violated the state constitution, but each justice in the majority wrote a separate opinion offering a different rationale for that result. One justice looked only at the words “unreasonable invasions of privacy” and, as the U.S. Supreme Court did in Roe, asserted that an unborn child “cannot be considered its own legal entity” in early pregnancy. Another dismissed human beings at that stage as nothing but an “amorphous collection of cells,” while a third justice emphasized that many women may not know they are pregnant and, therefore, would never have an opportunity to choose whether to have an abortion. Decisions like this, with many more to follow, identify opportunities for pro-life citizens to stand up for the unborn. Voters elect the legislators and governor responsible for each state’s abortions laws. In 49 states, the voters must approve changes to the state constitution and, in 25 of them (not South Carolina), can also initiate or propose changes. And in many states (again, not South Carolina), voters either elect or retain supreme court justices. Gender Identity. This issue is still being litigated primarily in federal court. Like most across the country, the public schools in St. John’s County, Florida, have bathrooms separated by biological sex. Officials in that school district, however, went a step further. More than a decade ago, they began providing gender-neutral bathrooms to accommodate students who wished not to use the bathroom for their biological sex. This was not good enough for Drew Adams, a biological female who began in high school to identify as a male. Adams challenged the policy, arguing that it violated both the U.S. Constitution’s requirement of equal protection and a federal statute’s ban on sex discrimination in programs receiving federal funds. >>> Safeguarding Parental Rights and Protecting Children from Federally Mandated Gender Ideology A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit initially agreed with Adams, but the full 11th Circuit voted 7-4 to reverse that decision. Judge Barbara Lagoa, appointed in 2019 by President Donald Trump, wrote the majority opinion which concluded that, under the appropriate legal standard, the bathroom policy was “substantially related” to the “important government objective” of protecting students’ privacy. Lagoa then wrote an individual opinion explaining that a contrary decision would have other far-reaching implications including its impact on women’s sports. This decision may reach the Supreme Court because another appeals court, the Fourth Circuit, came to opposite conclusion about a similar bathroom policy in a Virginia school district. This decision also points out what concerned citizens might do. Voters elect school boards that decide such policies and can participate in the public discussion about how to address issues like this one. They also elect members of Congress who establish educational policies in statutes such as Title IX. While members of the U.S. Supreme Court and lower federal appellate courts are not elected, the senators and president who appoint them are. These decisions show that while judges will continue to have a prominent role as decisionmakers, citizens can have significant influence on how to address such sensitive and important cultural issues."},

Parents are furious, and rightfully so. But lawmakers have a simple solution that reconnects the act of “affirming” a child with the idea that parents are a child’s primary caregivers. Bureaucrats who pull the levers deciding which part of the woke agenda that K-12 teachers should advance have applauded themselves for supporting so-called “gender” rights. Teachers unions, Teach for America (which recruits teachers for schools in low-income areas), and even the U.S. Department of Education are among those who have issued statements supporting the process of not questioning a child’s decision to “assume” a different gender, an ambiguous choice that usually signals the child is struggling with anxiety and depression. It often starts like this: A student shows emotional distress—again, depression or long periods of sadness or anger. This could be the result of bullying, struggling with schoolwork, or having trouble making friends (or just being a child). All of this means that the child needs attention—help from family members and teachers, working together to guide them through the rough parts of growing up. Yet the ambiguous “gender” craze has swept up K-12 students, girls in particular, and created nothing short of a contagion, analysts say. Children with low self-esteem may see material online that urges them to think their anxiety is caused by being born the wrong sex. Such material is altogether too easy to find on social media. Then, if they decide to assume a different gender—a distortion of the concept of biological sex—many educators and medical professionals will not question the child’s self-diagnosis. >>> Safeguarding Parental Rights and Protecting Children from Federally Mandated Gender Ideology In some states—New Jersey and California, to name just two—school officials operate under rules that can leave parents in the dark about the decision. These rules often keep parents out of life-altering conversations, potentially leaving troubled children with no one to help them deal with the underlying problems of mental illness or emotional trauma. And that’s when things can go very, very wrong. Educators are guiding more and more young people along the path to medical interventions, stalling puberty and altering their hormones. Many of those students grow to regret this. They are now speaking out, anguishing over the fact that no one warned them about the unalterable effects of these medications and, ultimately, the surgeries that remove or damage vital reproductive organs. Young people are left with disfigured bodies and a lifetime of sorrow. And parents were cut out of the process from the beginning. That’s why state policymakers are acting to reinsert parents and family members into the critical conversations teachers are having with students and to prevent educators from letting students diagnose themselves and ask for treatment. With the “Given Name Act,” no school official can address a child by a name different than the name listed on the child’s birth certificate or another official document without express permission from parents. Likewise, educators cannot call a child by a pronoun that does not match the sex listed on a birth certificate apart from a talk with parents. This proposal would prevent teachers from helping a young child accelerate down the path leading to irreparable changes to their bodies without involving families. We do not treat children for any other medical or therapeutic issues without parent involvement and thorough testing, so confusion about their sex should not be treated differently. >>> West Virginia Wins Day on Fairness in Women’s Sports but Plot Thickens on Title IX Lawmakers in states such as Arizona and Indiana are considering these proposals now. A similar proposal has been introduced in Utah. Requiring a teacher to use the name parents wrote on their child’s birth certificate may sound simple, but this small act correctly slows down the progression that leads children to harm their bodies and make choices they may regret later. Research finds that nearly all cases in which a young person was confused about their sex as a child resolved naturally later, without hormone treatments and other disfiguring medical interventions. Instead of rushing children to alter their bodies, school officials must work together with parents to treat the underlying causes of a student’s troubles and offer empathy and appropriate treatment. But parents or guardians and family members must be at the start, middle, and end of those conversations."},

On Jan. 26, the Colorado Court of Appeals decided that he violated state law by declining to create a custom cake to celebrate a man’s “gender transition.” The decision shows that courts still don’t get what religious freedom really means. Phillips and his wife, Debra, are Christian co-owners of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Lakewood, Colorado. In business since 1993, Masterpiece sells pre-made goodies in the store, and custom cakes that Jack designs and creates. Phillips has said that he strives to be obedient to Jesus Christ “in all aspects of his life,” including in his business and in exercising his personal skill in creating designer cakes. To that end, the Masterpiece website states that Phillips “cannot create custom cakes that express messages or celebrate events that conflict with his religious beliefs.” Like other states, however, Colorado has a law, the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act (CADA), that prohibits discrimination in “places of public accommodation,” including businesses, on the basis of, among other things, sexual orientation. LGBT activists claim that, by declining to create cakes for same-sex weddings or to celebrate gender transitions, Phillips violates the CADA by discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation. Here's a recap of Phillips’ first round. In 2012, a same-sex couple asked him to create a cake for their wedding. When he declined, they filed a discrimination complaint with the Colorado Civil Rights Commission (CCRC). The U.S. Supreme Court eventually ruled in Phillips’ favor, but on factual grounds unique to that case. Statements and actions by CCRC members, the Court held, “cast doubt on the fairness and impartiality of the Commission’s adjudication of Phillips’ case.” >>> Big Docket Gets Bigger: Supreme Court Grants Review in Case on Employees’ Religious Rights That’s a polite way of saying that the CCRC’s overt and ugly anti-religious bigotry fell far short of “the First Amendment’s guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion.” The Court stopped there, however, and did not address more generally how to handle these conflicts between civil rights statutes and the First Amendment right to freely exercise one’s religion. Which brings us to Phillips’ second round. Autumn Scardina, a biological male who identifies as a woman, asked Masterpiece to create a custom pink birthday cake with blue frosting. Another Masterpiece employee initially said that Phillips could create such a cake but, when Scardina then revealed that the party, and the cake, were to celebrate Scardina’s gender transition, Phillips declined. Scardina could have purchased a pink cake with blue frosting almost anywhere, but chose Masterpiece. Scardina specifically sought a custom cake that Phillips would personally create, asking for one without an explicit message and withholding the information certain to elicit a refusal. This gambit was so that Phillips’ religious exercise objection would be based on how the cake was used rather than its objective appearance. One way or another, Scardina was determined to deprive Phillips of any room for exercising his faith while staying in business. Scardina’s suit alleged that, by refusing to sell “a birthday cake” because Scardina “is transgender,” Masterpiece violated both the Colorado Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) and CADA. The trial court, however, rejected Scardina’s CCPA claim. Scardina claimed to have gone to Masterpiece because of Phillips’ public statements that he would sell cakes to LGBT customers. That might have constituted commercial speech under CCPA’s jurisdiction. In fact, the court noted, Scardina targeted Phillips because he had explained his religious beliefs when discussing his previous Supreme Court case. This was, instead, speech about “a matter of public concern” that was beyond CCPA’s reach. The trial court, however, agreed with Scardina on the CADA claim. The court concluded that, if the cake Scardina requested conveyed “a celebratory message about gender transitions,” it would be attributed to Scardina rather than to Phillips and, therefore, did not amount to compelled speech. And the trial court rejected Phillips’ religious exercise claim because CADA is “a neutral law of general applicability” that did not target religious belief. The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court’s decision. Withdrawing its initial agreement to make the cake after Scardina disclosed “what the cake was for,” the court said, showed that it was “Scardina’s transgender status…that caused Masterpiece and Phillips to refuse to provide the cake.” The court was simply wrong on the facts. Phillips has no problem making a custom pink cake with blue frosting for a man who identifies as a woman and, had that been the request, would have done so for Scardina. The disclosure of “what the cake was for,” however, turned that generic request into one that would require Phillips to knowingly contribute to celebrating something that violated his religious beliefs. That, no doubt, was exactly what Scardina had in mind. In other words, Phillips made his decision about making this custom cake not based on anything related to Scardina, but on something very important to him: his exercise of religion. This is what courts, like the one in this case, don’t seem to grasp. >>> Court spotlights ACLU fallacy in 'Masterpiece' ruling Phillips, like other religious business owners, is simply trying to preserve a small, but vital, “safe space” in which he can pursue both his commercial skill and his personal faith. Doing so will not prevent any customer from obtaining any cake they want for whatever purpose they choose. One website, for example, lists no less than 49 cake shops and bakeries in Denver – and those are just the “best” ones. Crossing this line, however, means that Phillips must either violate his religious beliefs or pay dearly for being faithful. LGBT activists bringing these legal challenges do not simply want to buy a particular cake, floral arrangement, or photograph, they want to obtain such things by forcing someone to violate their religious beliefs. The Supreme Court found a way to avoid addressing this conflict in Phillips’ first case but hopefully they will address it soon. We’re witnessing what once was considered a fundamental and inalienable right to exercise religion—a right with roots extending long before the United States was born—being overwhelmed by an ideological campaign that, so far at least, seems to have the courts confused about what religious freedom really is."},

Not those of women or those who believe in natural marriage. Biden encouraged Congress to pass the Equality Act “to ensure LGBTQ Americans, especially transgender young people, can live with safety and dignity.” But we know what this is code for. Last year, Congress passed the misnamed Respect for Marriage Act. The bill pretends to protect same-sex marriages from discrimination. Instead, it redefines marriage as between any two people—not between one man and one woman, as the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act had enshrined before it was repealed. Since the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, same-sex marriages have received the same rights as other marriages. This includes access to insurance, hospital visitation policies, jointly owned assets, and more. The Respect for Marriage Act did not provide any new rights to same-sex couples. It did, however, place a target on the backs of religious institutions and organizations and people of faith. Think about the ongoing litigation that Jack Phillips, the Christian baker, is facing from radical pro-LGBTQ groups. Or the recent Supreme Court case 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis. Here, a Christian graphic designer faced discrimination charges when she refused to design wedding websites for same-sex couples—something that would have violated her beliefs about marriage. Similarly, if the Equality Act passes, it would spell the end of coherent protections based on sex in all aspects of public life. Males posing as females would have the right to compete (and dominate) in girls sports. It would require doctors, against their will, to perform sex-sterilization surgeries on healthy people for the purpose of “gender transitioning.” Gender identity would replace biological sex when it comes to workplace policies, bathroom access, military drafts for combat, and more. Women and children would bear the brunt of these policies. The Equality Act would erase their strengths and gifts by allowing men to masquerade as women. Additionally, Biden’s address should wake up Americans to the national move to restrict “gender transition” drugs and surgeries for minors. As of today, laws passed in seven states would, if upheld by the courts, protect children from puberty blockers, mastectomies, castration, and other radical procedures done in the name of bad gender medicine. Four other states are following suit. The Equality Act harms women, children, and all those who understand mammalian biology. While he spoke in lofty terms about “our duty to protect all the people’s rights and freedoms” last night, Biden’s address failed to protect the rights and freedoms of women and children—the two groups most harmed by his radical agenda.

Pesky fundamentals such as reading, writing, and arithmetic are being submerged under a tsunami of cultural Marxism. Parents—once viewed as the natural authority figures in their children’s lives—now find themselves largely spectators: locked out, lied to, and gaslit in a national effort to secretly gender-transition children in public schools behind their parents’ backs. But parents are fighting back. In at least 6,000 public schools across the country, children are being encouraged to inch toward fateful decisions with lifelong impact, all without their parent’s knowledge or consent. Could these clandestine transition policies and practices be the reason for the alarming spike in the number of high schoolers identifying as transgender? The U.S. saw a nearly five-fold increase in gender transition surgeries for teens from 2016 to 2019 alone. And a new report indicates that approximately 300,000 adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17 now identify as transgender. >>> Gender Ideology and the Future of the Human Person It is not surprising, then, that disenfranchised parents have finally had it. They are filing lawsuits from coast to coast to restore to parents what has always been rightfully theirs: the authority to parent their own children. The family, after all, predates government and public education itself. In Foote v. Ludlow School Community, the parents of two minor children sued a school district for violating their civil rights based on a policy at Baird Middle School in Ludlow, Massachusetts. That policy: secretly promote and facilitate gender transitions without parental consent. In this case, both parents had specifically directed the school not to discuss gender identity with their children. They sued in federal court for violations of their rights under the U.S. and Massachusetts constitutions, including their right to religious freedom, familial privacy, and what the Supreme Court has long recognized as the fundamental right to direct the upbringing of one’s own children. One defendant, the superintendent of public schools, publicly decried the parents’ concerns as “intolerance of LGBTQ people thinly veiled behind a camouflage of parental rights.” As if we had any doubt about how trans-happy public educators feel about nosy parents. The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs’ case, categorizing the middle school’s policy as “curriculum” over which parents would not ordinarily exercise control. But this argument, parroted by the defendants, cleverly obfuscates the fact that policies such as these impinge on historically sacrosanct areas of parental authority. A century of Supreme Court jurisprudence supports the notion that parents enjoy the fundamental constitutional right to direct the upbringing, health, and education of their children. As recently as 2000, in fact, the court called it “perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized.” The list of similar lawsuits continues to grow. In the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, another group of parents has appealed a decision dismissing their lawsuit with similar claims against Montgomery County, Maryland, public schools. >>> “Gender,” Marxism, and the Search for Power In the 8th Circuit, parents have appealed the trial court’s denial of their request for an injunction against an Iowa school district policy that not only facilitates secret social gender transitions but punishes students who don’t toe the party line. Specifically, students face punishment for “misgendering” others, defined as “intentionally or accidentally us[ing] the incorrect name or pronouns to refer to a person.” Parental rights suits focusing on secret transition policies have also been filed in state courts in Wisconsin and California, among others. The fight has even found its way to Congress. The Prohibiting Parental Secrecy Policies in Schools Act, sponsored by Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), would withhold federal funding from schools that fail to require parental permission before a student can change their name or pronouns at school. The bill was offered in response to a lawsuit filed by Aurora Regino, who is suing California's Chico Unified School District after a counselor allegedly helped her 10 (yes, TEN) year-old daughter secretly transition. The National Association of School Principals vocally backs these policies. It advises keeping parents in the dark about their children’s gender identities and calls on schools to remind parents that not supporting the rights of transgender students “runs contrary to the values of the school.” Apparently, NASP believes a school’s “values” trump a parent’s constitutional rights. For American educators bent on quietly transitioning children, it’s time to face the music. So, to battle-weary parents, I say: Play on."},

"], "text": "The idea that a young child has a gender identity contrary to his or her biological sex is widely unpopular. In a New York Times/Siena Poll released in September, 70% of registered voters were strongly or somewhat opposed to teaching elementary school children about gender identity and sexual orientation. More than half were opposed to teaching middle school students about this topic, and 42% were opposed to teaching it to high school students. In another survey conducted by Parents Defending Education (PDE), 56% of parents said they “believe it is inappropriate for schools to administer surveys to students on topics such as gender identity, sexual orientation,” along with drug use and sexual activity. It’s not that parents want teachers to avoid questions related to personal values and deeply held beliefs. Eighty-three percent of those in PDE’s poll were in favor of educators teaching about issues related to character and personal values. The same percentage of parents in a Heritage Foundation survey from 2020 also were in favor. Yet parents don’t want children to be exposed to books and classroom materials that show explicit pictures of sexual activity or replace sexual biology in favor of the ambiguous concept of “gender.” >>> Who Decides What Children Read? Authoritarians Slander Parent Groups as “Book Banners” They have reasons to be concerned, beyond the obvious confusion and trauma caused by showing children graphic pictures of sexual acts. Some of the original writers and expositors of gender ideology had even more radical ideas in mind than teaching students to use different pronouns. Judith Butler, best known for “Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity,” helped detach “gender” from biology by writing that not only can individuals change genders, they can also do this regularly. She writes that “gender is in no way a stable identity or locus of agency.” Butler advances this concept by aligning queer theory, an academic theory premised on the idea that sexuality, gender, and sex are oppressive social constructs, with other radical leftist theories such as critical race theory by saying, “The question of who and what is considered real and true is … a question of power.” And this is the concept that unites all “critical” theories, including critical race theory and critical gender studies or gender ideology. When the German academic and Marxist Max Horkheimer and his colleagues at the Frankfurt School expanded Marxism in the 1930s, they applied Marx’s view of conflict between economic classes to society and culture. Critical race theorists would later apply the power struggle to race, saying that America is systemically racist and civil rights are an illusion. Critical race theorist Kimberlé Crenshaw devised the concept known as “intersectionality” to describe what she claimed were overlapping examples of victimization between race and gender. In the introduction to Part Six of “Critical Race Theory: The Key Writings that Formed the Movement,” the editors describe Crenshaw’s idea that “identity movements based on gender and racial liberation” must “address the ‘intersectionality’ of social domination.”i In a chapter she contributed to the book, Crenshaw returns to the topic of social and political power. She writes, “The struggle over which differences matter [race, gender, ethnicity, etc.] and which do not is neither abstract nor insignificant … [T]hey raise critical issues of power.”ii Critical gender theorists argue that gender is a defining element of society and is also rooted in the struggle for power, and they provide direct references to Marxism. Gayle Rubin, another gender theorist, explored this topic in “The Traffic in Women: Notes on the ‘Political Economy’ of Sex,” where Rubin writes, “There is no theory which accounts for the oppression of women—in its endless variety and monotonous similarity, cross-culturally and throughout history—with anything like the explanatory power of the Marxist theory of class oppression.” >>> Safeguarding Parental Rights and Protecting Children from Federally Mandated Gender Ideology In “Thinking Sex,” Rubin writes, “A radical theory of sex must identify, describe, explain, and denounce erotic injustice and sexual oppression.” Rubin defends incest and sodomy and says that laws prohibiting these acts are oppressive. Then Rubin pays tribute to Marx, saying, “Feminist thought is greatly indebted to Marxism. In a sense, Marxism enabled people to pose a whole set of questions that Marxism could not satisfactorily answer.” Logically, then, queer theorists believe that the rejection of radical gender theories is the same as racial discrimination. To these radicals, being appalled at incest, for example, “has more in common with ideologies of racism than with true ethics. It grants virtue to the dominant groups, and relegates vice to the underprivileged.”iii Parents can and do object to K-12 instruction on gender identity without also knowing the underlying theory’s obsession with power. For parents, rejecting radical gender theory is a matter of protecting their children. The rest of us, though, should reject queer theory’s attempt to gain control of the next generation. i “Introduction to ‘Part Six: Intersection of Race and Gender’” in Critical Race Theory: The Key Writings that Formed the Movement, edited by Kimberlé Crenshaw et al.

It’s not popular at home. The more Americans grasp the horrors of what gender ideology is, the more they reject it. Its growing presence in medicine and K-12 schools is most polarizing. Beneath its euphemisms, gender ideology is irrational, destructive, and anti-human. Nevertheless, the left is trying to bully and confuse Americans into accepting it. Meanwhile, President Biden is directing the full financial and diplomatic heft of the U.S. government to export gender ideology and other such pet projects. Yet they’re more than unpopular in the developing world—they’re toxic. The gender radicals make no secret of their plans. The presidential memorandum on advancing “LGBTQI+ rights” abroad was the outline. The National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality is the blueprint. And the U.S. government juggernaut is now using it to bully smaller, poorer developing countries. Woe to the religious believers and traditional families who stand in the way. >>> U.S. Promotion of Abortion Abroad Is Ideological Colonialism, Not Gender Equality Such families live in countries as far from each other as Indonesia, Guatemala, and Uganda. They profess different religious beliefs and come from diverse racial and ethnic groups. But they share traditional beliefs about marriage, family, and sexual morality. They believe that God created men and women to be different for good reason. To the Biden team, these convictions are old-fashioned and bigoted. And they’re determined to use American diplomacy and foreign assistance to try and convert them. Last year USAID rewrote its gender policy to reflect the left’s obsession with gender theory. The word “gender” used to be a polite alternative to “sex.” But USAID redefined it as a social construct, and “gender identity” as a “self-determined” sense of oneself. These new definitions open the category of “women” to anyone, male or female, who identifies as one. Today, USAID boasts a network of over 180 gender advisors embedded in its offices throughout the world. These gender advisors integrate the agency’s gender equity and equality goals into programming. USAID recently released a new guide on “Integrating LGBTQI+ Considerations Into Education Programming.” It recommends “train[ing] educators to model the use of inclusive language (i.e., names, pronouns, descriptors).” It says that lessons should include information about “diverse sexual orientations and gender identities.” The guide goes on to instruct its partners to avoid “policies based on a gender binary.” It urges them to support “students who want to express a different gender than what was assigned at birth.” And it promotes resources from GLSEN, the influential activist group that promotes gender ideology in classrooms. USAID isn’t the only government agency on this mission. The State Department has an open grant for $1.5 million to participate in the Global Equality Fund. Recipients of this grant will empower local “LGBTQI+” communities and promote social inclusion. Last year another grant funded lobbying to increase “LGBTQI+” acceptance in Botswana. >>>Botswana to Become the Latest Target of Biden State Department’s Ideological Colonialism In fact, the State Department requires grant applications to include a “gender and inclusion analysis.” It must include “gender norms, equity and equality for underserved communities and marginalized populations.” In other words, hopeful grant recipients must endorse these ideas before getting a single dollar. Those who refuse cannot even compete for funds. USAID dispenses billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars in the developing world. In many places it has done good work. But now, it posts the genderbread person bearing the motto “from the American people” in those countries too. These images, and the ideology they serve, are anathema to traditional religions and cultures. Using conditional aid to pursue worldwide adherence to gender ideology is wrong. It’s also foolish. While China and Russia buy influence across the global South, the U.S. is tarnishing its good name in developing countries. Gender ideology is poison to African children and families too, and they know it. Whatever good will the U.S. might earn through genuine aid to the developing world, we are squandering by pushing the latest craze of the sexual left."},

Maggie Mertens acknowledges sex differences between men and women in sports in her essay. But she claims that “researchers today still don’t know how much of this to attribute to biological difference versus the lack of support provided to women athletes to reach their highest potential.” Mertens thinks a case of one female athlete and several allusions to “science” that questions biological sex differences are enough to destroy the entire concept of the sex binary. The dominant narrative around transgenderism has moved from gender dysphoria and clinical discussions of mental health disorders to cultural conversations about gender identity, personal pronouns, and affirmation. The final step in colonizing public policy and social norms is eradicating the reality of biological differences between men and women. Mertens took to Twitter to justify her views by linking to an article that claims the existence of intersex conditions proves the idea of two sexes is “overly simplistic.” The truth is that rare genetic conditions reaffirm the sex binary, rather than challenge it. There is no third sex or third gamete. And the “secondary” sex differences are well-established. Mertens denies this reality when she claims scientists have challenged the belief that boys are on average bigger, stronger, and faster than girls. But as the saying goes, “That’s why they play the game.” Florence Griffith-Joyner is generally acknowledged as the fastest woman in history. Her time of 10.49 seconds in the 100-meter dash is still a world record for female sprinters, but is not even among the top 6,000 times for men. Professional basketball is no different. The WNBA shared a video in 2017 of every dunk in the 20-year history of the league to that point. The video was 71 seconds long. The USA women’s soccer team—winners of the 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cup—dominates the pitch when squaring off against female players from across the globe. That didn’t matter to the teenage boys who defeated professional women almost twice their age in a 2017 match. Mertens would probably repeat this line from her essay to explain those outcomes: In the world of radical gender ideology, testosterone is apparently a social construct. The inner workings of the human mind are complex. That’s why the gender debate is largely focused on how people “identify” based on whether they “feel” like a man or woman. The outward functioning of the human body is much simpler and easier to detect. Either a man can bench press 250 pounds or he can’t. Either a woman has a 40-inch vertical jump or she doesn’t. Rare as these performance measures are, all the people who possess such otherworldly athletic ability are men. Acknowledging this fact is not sexist. It respects female athletes for their immense talent on their own merits, not in comparison to their male peers. The Atlantic, like many other institutions dominated by the Left, thinks it can create the world of its choosing ex nihilo. This impulse reflects a god complex that is common with people who cannot accept a world in which differences in outcomes exist across groups. It’s much easier for them to reshape cultural norms in their own image than appreciate the reality that men and women—designed by their Creator—are equal in worth and dignity, but different in form and function. Ultimately, the girl in the story did not join the team. Although her school approved her request to play, she quit because she was upset by the tests she had to undergo before being declared eligible to compete. I hope she continues to enjoy the game of football, but it’s hard to miss the irony of an article arguing that teenage girls are strong enough to play tackle football with boys ending with the protagonist quitting because her feelings were hurt by adults. Human nature remains undefeated. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

The decision Wednesday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit was a major win for the First Amendment right to be free from compelled speech. In Green v. Miss United States of America, LLC, transgender activist Anita Green claimed that the pageant’s policy of allowing only “natural born” women to compete violated Oregon’s anti-discrimination law, called the Oregon Public Accommodations Act. That law prohibits discrimination on account of—among other things—sex or sexual orientation in places of public accommodation. Like the trial court, the appeals court rejected Green’s argument, explaining that beauty pageants, as a type of theatrical production, enjoy the First Amendment’s protection of freedom of speech or expressive conduct.  The U.S. Supreme Court has held—in Southeastern Productions v. Conrad (1975) and Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Group of Boston (1995), for example—that expressive conduct of this kind is entitled to the same First Amendment protection as any other form of speech. In writing for the 2-1 majority, Judge Lawrence VanDyke described the type of speech involved in the case. In the same way that picketing involves holding a sign or leafleting involves standing on a sidewalk, VanDyke said, certain types of expressive conduct, including beauty pageants, allow “no daylight between speech and speaker.” Through the very act of holding a beauty pageant, the Miss United States of America organization was expressing its message: “This is the ideal vision of American womanhood.” By including and excluding certain people from participation, the pageant was choosing the best way to express that message. If producers of the hit Broadway musical “Hamilton” may decide to cast black actors in most roles, the court concluded in one analogy, the Miss United States of America pageant may reject contestants who aren’t what it’s looking for. Green claimed, remarkably, that no meaningful difference exists between Green and any of the pageant’s cisgender (biological) female contestants. But the appeals court disagreed, noting that Green’s belief was precisely the opposite of the message the pageant sought to communicate and what the First Amendment allowed the pageant to express. This was so even if transgender contestants had not communicated their transgender status outside the pageant and otherwise were indistinguishable from “natural born female” contestants, the two judges found. Forcing the pageant to adopt Green’s opinion fundamentally would alter what the pageant was communicating, that is, its view of who qualifies as an “ideal woman.” Writing for the majority, VanDyke described the pageant’s precise message: Under the First Amendment, VanDyke explained, any restriction on expressive conduct must be a narrowly tailored means of achieving a compelling government purpose —a standard known as “strict scrutiny.” The state of Oregon’s “compelling interest” behind passage of the Oregon Public Accommodations Act was in “eliminating discrimination against LGBTQ individuals.” Application of this law to the beauty pageant, however, necessarily would force the pageant to change its intended message and eliminate its “natural born female” rule and this, the appeals court determined, could not withstand strict scrutiny. VanDyke explained why: The factual record in the case includes an exchange between Green and Tanice Smith, national director of the Miss United States of America pageant association. Smith told Green that competing in the pageant wasn’t an option, but offered to help find a pageant for which Green would qualify. Green’s response was curt: “Well, I’ll talk to my attorney about this then, because discrimination is unacceptable.” Unacceptable? How about eliminating someone’s constitutional right to decide the messages they want and don’t want to convey? As the battle over preferred pronouns and compelled speech picks up, the legal victory of the Miss United States of America pageant undoubtedly will shape such cases in the future. This term, in fact, the U.S. Supreme Court will consider another showdown between a state’s anti-discrimination law and free speech. In 303 Creative v. Elenis, the high court will be asked to decide whether a Christian website designer’s constitutional rights under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment were violated when officials used the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act to force her to create websites for homosexual weddings.

"], "text": "The transgender bathroom wars don’t stop for the holidays. The latest battleground is Florida, where on Dec. 30, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, sitting en banc, ruled that the word “sex” in educational programs means being a biological “male” or “female.” In Adams v. School Board of St. Johns County, the court ruled that a school board’s policy of separating school bathrooms based on biological sex does not violate either the Constitution or federal civil rights law. Transgender male student Drew Adams (a biological female) challenged the policy in 2020, claiming that it violated the Constitution’s equal protection clause, which provides that no state may “deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” Adams also argued that the policy violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any educational program that receives federal funding. A three-judge appeals court panel initially agreed with Adams, but the full appeals court subsequently decided to take up the case and reconsider the ruling. The result was a 7-4 decision upholding the policy on both constitutional and statutory grounds. Judge Barbara Lagoa delivered the majority opinion. She began by identifying the “unremarkable—and nearly universal—practice of separating school bathrooms based on biological sex” at issue in the case. She then pointed to the court’s conclusion: Adams had argued that, by separating males and females, the school board’s bathroom policy necessarily discriminated against transgender students—those students who, despite their underlying biology, identify as either male or female. These sex-based separations were, Adams argued, a violation of the equal protection clause. The Supreme Court has held that legislative distinctions based on biological sex are subject to an “intermediate” standard of judicial review—a standard lower than “strict scrutiny,” which almost certainly makes it invalid, but higher than “rational basis,” which nearly always leaves it alone. To satisfy intermediate scrutiny, the bathroom policy had to (1) advance an important governmental objective; and (2) be substantially related to that objective. Lagoa wrote that the school bathroom policy cleared both hurdles because it advanced the important governmental objective of protecting students’ privacy in school bathrooms, and it did so in a way that was substantially related to that objective. With intermediate scrutiny satisfied, there was no equal protection violation. Regarding Adams’ claim of discrimination under Title IX, Lagoa wrote that the plain and ordinary meaning of “sex” in 1972, when Title IX was enacted, was biological sex. Because of that (and through its implementing regulations), Title IX envisioned the kind of sex-segregated bathrooms that the school board’s policy required. What’s more, the school board had attempted to accommodate transgender students by providing single-stall, sex-neutral bathrooms, which Title IX neither requires nor prohibits. Lagoa wrote that there was no reason, as the District Court had done, to consider “sex” ambiguous. The statutory scheme and purpose of Title IX, along with the vast majority of dictionary definitions at that time, clearly defined “sex” based on biology and reproductive function. By maintaining bathrooms separated by biological sex, the school board had satisfied its duties under Title IX. Though she wrote the majority opinion, Lagoa took the unusual step of also writing a separate concurring opinion, warning of the adverse impact that defining “sex” under Title IX to include “transgender status” or “gender identity” would have on the rights of girls and women in education and school sports. Reaching Adams’ desired outcome, she wrote, would have “repercussions far beyond the bathroom door.” She wrote: In her concurrence, Lagoa made many of the same arguments that we at The Heritage Foundation have made in countering the Biden administration’s pending and massive alteration of Title IX to include “transgender status” (among many other changes). The educational, athletic, and professional gains of women and girls over the course of five decades are in the crosshairs as the federal Department of Education’s rule-making process seeks to make the very changes that Lagoa decried. If such a profound cultural and policy change were to be made, it should come from Congress, rather than unelected judges or executive branch bureaucrats. The next phase of the bathroom wars could play out on a national scale. In 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review a similar case decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. In Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board, et al., the appeals court came to the opposite conclusion; namely, that Title IX and the Constitution’s equal protection clause protected a transgender male student (a biological female) from a school board’s bathroom policy that prohibited the student from using the bathroom that corresponded with that student’s gender identity. Such a clear split between two federal circuit courts on the same legal issue, especially one involving both the Constitution and a federal statute, makes it more likely that the Supreme Court will decide to settle the conflict. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito predicted such a development in a dissenting opinion more than two years ago. In Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia (2020), in an opinion by Justice Neil Gorsuch, the court interpreted the word “sex” in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination, to include “gender identity.” In excoriating the majority for “legislating,” instead of “interpreting,” Alito wrote: Many court-watchers see Bostock as the pebble that triggered an avalanche of court battles over the meaning of “sex” in federal law. Should Adams decide to appeal to the Supreme Court, the clock has already started ticking. All petitions for writ of certiorari must be filed within 90 days of entry of the federal appellate court’s judgment, making Adams’ request for review due somewhere around early April.

That’s exactly what San Francisco has just done with a program called Guaranteed Income for Transgender People, or GIFT. This is like using a fire hose to spray a burning skyscraper with gasoline. Talk about perverse incentives. Anyone want to bet that, if this program expands, the number of San Francisco’s poor who say they identify as transgender also will expand? Of course, San Francisco already is a lab for bad policy ideas. But giving guaranteed income to low-income residents who say they identify as transgender is surely next-level dumb. The GIFT pilot program “will provide 55 eligible residents with $1,200 per month for 18 months, as well as health care and financial coaching,” the Los Angeles Times explains. This scheme fuses bad fiscal policy with bad social policy. And the whole will be worse than the sum of its parts. To see why, let’s look at the details. First, note that this program doesn’t provide so-called universal basic income. It doesn’t target the whole population or even those in greatest financial need, but rather those with the greatest status in the intersectional hierarchy. In this case, that means residents, including minors, living at the intersection of economic poverty and transgender identity. The announcement says: To keep this gift of $1,200 a month from hindering eligibility for other programs, San Francisco claims that it’s simply a research pilot program. This is likely a ruse, however, since the city’s treasurer claims “there is no need to replicate broad-based ‘does it work?’ pilots or research studies.” In fact, San Francisco seeks to focus “on qualitative research that can tell the human stories about people receiving guaranteed income,” as we learn from the fine print. “Storytelling and narrative change are essential to build public will and debunk false narratives about poverty and deservedness.” In other words, the purpose of the GIFT pilot program is to get moving stories that can serve for an ad campaign to expand the program. We can assume, then, that San Francisco will avoid the sort of rigorous scientific evaluation that might expose the program’s failures. And we can assume that it will expand. Of course, we already have evidence that this scheme won’t reduce poverty in San Francisco. Over more than a decade, the federal government financed research on “guaranteed income” schemes. It supported randomized, controlled trials across six states conducted from 1968 to 1980. Guess what the U.S. government found? Recipients’ motivation to work dropped, regardless of their sex, marital status, or status as a parent. In fact, for every dollar in transfer payments, earnings fell by 66 cents. At that rate, it would take three dollars of taxpayer money to raise a recipient’s net income by one dollar. These results were a disaster for fans of guaranteed minimum income, universal basic income, negative income tax, or an unconditional cash transfer by any other name. But such facts don’t stand in the way of Aria Sa’id, executive director of San Francisco’s legally recognized Transgender District. After learning of the GIFT program, the transgender activist longed for more. “My dream,” Sa’id said, “is to take a firetruck with millions of dollars of cash and have a wind blower and say, ‘Have at it.’” Thankfully, most Americans have more common sense than to hose down city streets with twenty-dollar bills. More than 90% of the public agrees that “able-bodied adults who receive cash, food, housing, and medical assistance should be required to work or prepare for work as a condition of receiving those government benefits.” This lack of public support is no doubt why national politicians don’t push such “guaranteed income” schemes with much zeal. San Francisco voters, however, are far to the left of the average American voter. So, that city’s politicians respond to different incentives. Nevertheless, the bad outcome of this policy is still easy to envision. Just consider: The number of people identifying as transgender, nonbinary, and so forth has exploded in the last several years, especially among young people. This growth has been so alarming that it led Dr. Lisa Littman, a physician and researcher, to suggest a new diagnosis in 2017 that she called “rapid onset gender dysphoria.” This pandemic among the young has gotten far worse in the past five years. As a result, the United Kingdom’s National Health Service has been overwhelmed and recently chose to press pause on cross-sex hormones and related surgeries on minors. Anyone who studies the rise of gender ideology in schools, culture, and social media is bound to suspect that we are dealing with a new social contagion, not the rare gender dysphoria of the previous century. Gender transitioning is now, for many minors, a trend. But it so happens that this trend, unlike goth or grunge, leads to sterilizing cross-sex hormones and disfiguring surgery.

"], "text": "Second- and third-generation heirs of Walmart founder Sam Walton’s fortune have funneled millions of dollars into LGBTQ-related causes in their home state of Arkansas. Among other things, these Walton-funded groups and the Walmart Foundation have sponsored local drag shows and story hours for kids; “teens only” events for LGBTQ-identifying youth; and other progressive causes such as diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in public schools and the state university in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Sam Walton’s daughter Alice Walton and grandson Tom Walton, along with Tom’s wife Olivia, have been at the forefront of these initiatives. Last year, the Walton Family Foundation launched the Arkansas LGBTQ+ Advancement Fund in conjunction with the Alice L. Walton Foundation. The Walton Family Foundation and the Walmart Foundation are leading sponsors of Northwest Arkansas (NWA) Equality, an LGBTQ nonprofit based in Fayetteville. The group’s stated mission is “to provide programs, education, and advocacy to serve, connect, and empower the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community.” The Walmart Foundation first offered NWA Equality a “capacity building” grant in 2007 and has continued supporting the group in subsequent years. In 2018, the Walmart and Walton foundations donated around $2.5 million to fund a three-year training program in diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI, called TRUE Northwest Arkansas. NWA Equality was one of the first groups to receive a TRUE Northwest grant, which the Waltons offered in collaboration with the Transgender Equality Network. Walmart and the Waltons continued offering grants and capital gifts to NWA Equality as late as 2020. NWA Equality sponsors LGBTQ-related events in Arkansas’ Benton and Washington counties as part of the group’s stated efforts to “make drag accessible” to new audiences and to place drag shows “at the forefront of Northwest Arkansas’ social calendar.” NWA Equality’s Dickson Divas drag events, for instance, feature drag queen brunches and children’s story times to Arkansas residents. In Fayetteville, the group sponsors Northwest Arkansas Pride, the state’s largest LGBTQ pride celebration. The Equality Crew, a beneficiary of the Waltons’ 2021 LGBTQ+ Advancement Fund, hosted a children’s event during NWA Equality’s pride parade in June. The Equality Crew hosted an event called “Youth Zone” at the Walton Arts Center, named after the Walton family for its donations. One segment, titled “Kids Zone,” featured a “drag story time for younger children,” as stated in the advertisement. A “Teen Zone” was offered for students in grades six through 12, including “a DJ, local band, and TWO drag shows.” A “Sensory Zone,” clearly targeting children on the autism spectrum, was also available for “youth needing a break from the sights and sounds.” Gender confusion is particularly common among young people on the autism spectrum who have difficulty grasping social roles, making them particularly vulnerable to the suggestion that they should change their gender. The Equality Crew also scheduled a back-to-school night for “LGBTQ+ youth” at the Fayetteville Public Library over the summer. The event, advertised as “teens only,” sparked enough outrage that The Equality Crew canceled it, citing safety concerns. The Equality Crew wrote in its original announcement of the event that “community partners in support of LGBQ+ youth” would be stationed throughout the library. Youth could get free haircuts from local stylists and clothing from the Transition Closet, another Walton-funded nonprofit that donates clothes and accessories to Arkansas residents who say they’re seeking gender transition. A dance party had been scheduled at night, which certain adults would chaperone despite the event’s being advertised as “teens only.” The Fayetteville library’s executive director, David Johnson, told a local Arkansas news station shortly after the event’s cancellation that the library started receiving complaints after posting information about the event online. Most concerns were centered on the dance party and an associated drag show, Johnson said. The Equality Crew wrote in an Aug. 4 statement that the event was canceled “largely due … to the increasing number of violent and disruptive attacks on parents, children, and organizers seeking to serve members of the LGBTQ+ community or provide inclusive programming, particularly in public library spaces around the world.” The statement added: The Walton Family Foundation, the Walmart Foundation, Northwest Arkansas Equality, The Equality Crew, the Transgender Equality Network, the Transition Closet, and the Fayetteville Public Library didn’t respond to The Daily Signal’s requests for comment by publication time.

That’s bad enough, but since it’s written so vaguely it would do a lot more than that.", "Anyone, including a minor, could have a right to abortion, birth control, or other reproductive surgeries like the removal of healthy breasts.", "Proposition 3 fails to protect minors or the rights of parents to be involved in the well-being and medical care of their children."], "text": "When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in its Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision this summer, abortion did not become illegal in the U.S. The court simply ruled (rightly) that there is no right to an abortion in the U.S. Constitution. That returned the question of abortion to the states. Some states had preexisting pro-life laws that soon sprung to life. Other states responded with new protections for unborn human beings. Some states’ highest courts have claimed a right to abortion was secretly lurking in their state constitutions all along. Finally, some states are pushing to create such a right in their state laws. Perhaps the most egregious is Proposition 3, the “Right to Reproductive Freedom” state constitutional amendment, which is up for a vote next month in Michigan. Proposition 3 would enshrine abortion as an absolute right in state law. That’s bad enough, but since it’s written so vaguely—probably by design—it would do a lot more than that. If voters approve this amendment, they could unwittingly be rejecting not only the right of the unborn to life, but the rights of parents to protect and direct the upbringing of their minor children. The first concern—the rights of parents—comes from Proposition 3’s use of the term “individual.” It means that anyone, including a minor, could have a right to abortion, birth control, or other reproductive surgeries like the removal of healthy breasts. All without the knowledge or consent of parents. What happens if a young girl is the victim of abuse? Under this law, the abuser or scared boyfriend—also an “individual”—could badger her into having an abortion. The parents would thus lose the chance to intervene or prosecute. Beyond abortion, this amendment would provide access to birth control and cross-sex hormones. Parents across the United States are fighting teachers and administrators who socially transition their sons or daughters without the parents’ knowledge or consent. In many states, schools are the mouth of a pipeline that leads to gender clinics and cross-sex hormones—again administered without parents’ consent. Parents are best equipped to protect and care for their child’s well-being. They have both the right and responsibility to do so. Proposition 3 would take that right away and leave it up to minors or the influence of other adult gender ideologues. How is this possible? The chief mischief lies in the phrase “reproductive freedom,” which courts are bound to apply to far more than abortion. First, on abortion, Proposition 3 is radical. It would wipe out Michigan’s modest pre-Dobbs protections for unborn human beings. That includes a law protecting children born alive after botched abortions. If that law falls, then in Michigan, a right to an abortion will become a right to a dead baby. In the same way, Proposition 3 could override Michigan’s ban on the ghoulish practice of partial-birth abortion, a ban most Michiganders support. It would also pave the way for eugenic abortions, or abortions based on sex, disability, or race. A woman (or the man coercing her) could argue that giving birth, or even a failed abortion that leads to a live birth, would cause undue “harm” to her mental health. On these grounds alone, this law would make abortion for any reason legal during all nine months of pregnancy. What if a woman suffers medical malpractice from her abortion or is coerced into receiving one? By prohibiting the state from “discriminating” against someone who assists a woman in her abortion, it leaves the woman vulnerable to harm and with limited legal recourse. The state, and each person voting on this amendment, has a vested interested in protecting minors, parental rights, and live children over abortion. For a long time, the Supreme Court and federal law have prohibited taxpayer dollars from funding abortions. Most taxpayers support this. Under Proposition 3, though, Michigan taxpayer dollars could fund abortions, birth control, cross-sex hormones, fertility treatments, and even puberty blockers. Second, under Proposition 3, reproductive care includes, but is not limited to, protections for “contraception, sterilization … and infertility care.” That would create an individual right to birth control, morning-after pills, cross-sex hormones, sex sterilization surgeries, or other harmful chemicals that alter the normal functioning of the male or female body. Even if you support the use of these treatments, very few people support Proposition 3’s blatant rejection of age requirements, parental rights, or the requirement that taxpayers fund these expenses. Michigan’s Proposition 3 is a radical amendment that goes beyond Roe v. Wade. It fails to protect minors or the rights of parents to be involved in the well-being and medical care of their children. If all that weren’t bad enough, Proposition 3 hopes to achieve this on the taxpayers’ dime. Is that really what Michiganders really want? This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

Not So Much", "author": ["Grace  Melton", "Simon  Hankinson"], "date": "Dec 13, 2022 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/religious-liberty/commentary/the-us-cares-about-religious-freedom-abroad-home-not-so-much", "takeaways": ["Here at home, the federal government is seeking to compel people to betray their religious beliefs.", "The Equality Act would stigmatize the religious beliefs held by millions of people, Christians, Jews, and Muslims alike.", "If the U.S. is to hold other countries accountable for their abuses, it needs to stop assaulting religious liberty here at home."], "text": "The State Department has now designated 12 “Countries of Particular Concern” and placed four more on a “Special Watch List” under the International Religious Freedom Act “for having engaged in or tolerated particularly severe violations of religious freedom.” Yet here at home, the federal government is seeking to compel people to betray their religious beliefs. While such violations of religious freedom pale in comparison to those that China and Iran perpetrate, they are attacks on conscience nonetheless. And the hypocrisy is inescapable. The State Department announcement came the same week that Congress disrespected religious liberty by passing the Respect for Marriage Act. Ostensibly about codifying the Supreme Court’s Obergefell v. Hodges decision on same-sex marriage, this legislation sets the stage for dissenting religious organizations and nonprofit organizations to lose their tax-exempt status and licenses to operate. The act provides no new benefit for civilly married same-sex couples. It does, however, give activists and bureaucrats new tools to harass people and institutions that profess traditional beliefs about marriage. It’s been clear from the start that the Biden administration doesn’t prioritize religious freedom. Religious freedom is a fundamental right that upholds others. But Secretary of State Antony Blinken argued that it is just one “co-equal” and “interdependent” right. That’s because it’s a stumbling block for the Left’s pursuit of an ideological agenda that is even less popular in the developing world than it is here. As it turns out, devaluing religious freedom is a critical step in promoting rights based on sexual orientation or gender identity. >>> Radical “Respect for Marriage Act” Could Spell End of Religious Tax Exemptions Last year, the House of Representatives passed the deceptively named Equality Act to do just that. It added the subjective categories of sexual orientation and gender identity to prohibited grounds of discrimination and expands the definition of “public accommodations.” These changes would weaponize civil rights law to punish those who don’t espouse the Left’s new orthodoxy on sex and “gender identity.” The Equality Act would stigmatize the religious beliefs held by millions of people, Christians, Jews, and Muslims alike, and require single-sex spaces to include anyone based on self-identified gender identity. This month, the Supreme Court heard 303 Creative v. Elenis, the case of Lorie Smith, a Christian website designer who objects to Colorado law forcing her to create messages in support of same-sex marriage that violate her conscience. Unsurprisingly, the Biden Justice Department is siding with Colorado in opposing Smith’s freedom of religion and speech. Among the questions before the court is where the line is between conduct and speech. Denying the service of selling a cake or a website to someone because he is gay is illegal conduct. Refusing to express a particular message that violates the creator’s conscience is protected under the First Amendment. This doesn’t apply just to Christians. What if the Black Hebrew Israelites in New York asked a Hasidic jeweler to engrave a piece with “We are the real Jews” or if a Hindu-owned print shop was asked to make T-shirts with the slogan “Pakistan Zindabad?” >>> Claims of Free Speech, Anti-Gay Discrimination Court in Website Designer’s Case Clash at Supreme The United States has a proud history of tolerating rather than compelling sectarian religious beliefs. But when it comes to questions of sexual morality, the Left now seeks more than tolerance. Acceptance and adherence are its new demands. Indeed, the Left’s idea of “progress” is for everyone to adopt leftist views. If traditionalists don’t reach liberal enlightenment on their own, coercion may be necessary. One need look no further than Canada or Great Britain to see these same trends playing out. Progressive orthodoxy on gender wokeism has led to countless instances of sacrificing free speech and religious belief on the altar of gender ideology. In announcing the International Religious Freedom designations, Blinken promised that the U.S. will “advocate for those facing religious persecution or discrimination.” We should indeed promote religious liberty overseas, but if the U.S. is to hold other countries accountable for their abuses, it needs to stop assaulting religious liberty here at home."},

"], "text": "There’s no stronger instinct than a parent’s need to protect his or her child. Last year, a California woman fought off a mountain lion—with her bare hands. Why? Because the predator was dragging away her 5-year-old son. She heard a commotion, ran outside and immediately began punching the mountain lion. It fled, and she saved her son’s life. That’s why school boards shouldn’t be surprised when angry parents call them out for injecting critical race theory (or its school-uniformed version, social and emotional learning) into their children’s classrooms. Because it’s not just the lives of our children that need protection—it’s also their innocence. From “Drag Queen Story Hour” to “woke” math, from secret school Pride parades to teachers who look to young children for their gender validation, childhood innocence is under assault. >>> The U.K. Cracks Down While the U.S. Doubles Down on “Gender Affirming” Care As two of my colleagues at the Heritage Foundation noted in a 2019 commentary, “In culture, education, and health care, American children also are increasingly targeted for sexual messages, images, and themes at younger ages.” Creating confusion in our children is the point. As one academic journal explained in 2021, drag queen story hour “creates a pathway into the imaginative, messy, and rule-breaking aspects of drag for children without necessarily watering down queer cultures.” The title of that piece is “Drag pedagogy: The playful practice of queer imagination in early childhood,” and its authors are listed as Harper Keenan and “Lil Miss Hot Mess.” “Ultimately, we suggest that drag pedagogy offers one model for learning not simply about queer lives, but how to live queerly,” they write (emphasis theirs). “And we’re living for it.” There’s a clear goal of creating a “new generation of drag kids,” as erotic clothing store owner Brandon Hilton puts it, as he celebrates a 9-year-old boy in makeup and a sequined body suit. But there’s a mountain of research on the results of the early sexualization of children. It can be just as deadly as any mountain lion. This assault on innocence has its defenders, of course. Psychologist Joe Kort, a “certified sexologist,” says that objections to drag queen story-hour programs are simply misogyny, homophobia and bigotry. Writing in Psychology Today, Kort contends, “As a longtime sex and gender therapist, I know that there is no substance to the argument that exposing anyone, including children, to the reality of people with a different sexual orientation or gender identity influences the children’s innate sexual orientation or gender identity.” The real victims of this movement disagree. Social contagion is a recognized scientific phenomenon. And what we’ve seen regarding gender questions is that what begins as confusion—common enough in children and young adolescents—is often turned into a clinical course of action, with tragic results. “I saw a community full of so many people who had transitioned and it had finally made them happy,” one woman explains. “I looked at them and thought I would be happy too. I now know that I’m not a trans man—but I didn’t have enough therapy to explore what was really going on with me.” >>> Biden Administration Abandons Biology. What’s Next for Parents? Here’s another: “When Chloe was 12 years old, she decided she was transgender,” the New York Post reports. “At 13, she came out to her parents. That same year, she was put on puberty blockers and prescribed testosterone. At 15, she underwent a double mastectomy. Less than a year later, she realized she’d made a mistake—all by the time she was 16 years old.” At age 15, Keira Bell was diagnosed with gender dysphoria after Britain’s National Health Service referred her to the Tavistock and Portman clinic in London. “The consequences of what happened to me have been profound,” Keira writes. “…the further my transition went, the more I realized that I wasn’t a man, and never would be. We are told these days that when someone presents with gender dysphoria, this reflects a person’s ‘real’ or ‘true’ self, that the desire to change genders is set. But this was not the case for me. As I matured, I recognized that gender dysphoria was a symptom of my overall misery, not its cause.” Pushing radical gender ideology onto our children—in classrooms, in libraries and even in church—is inherently dangerous. It’s an attempt to undermine the childhood innocence that families instinctively protect. G.K. Chesterton wrote, “For kids are innocent and love justice, while most of us are evil and naturally prefer mercy.” But those who come for our children should not expect mercy. They should expect, instead, parents ready to protect their children no matter what."},

", "Title IX does not give the administration the power or scope to completely alleviate women of responsibility for the consequences of their sex. "], "text": "The Department of Education’s 90-day comment period ended Monday for proposed rule changes for Title IX. What is the Biden administration trying to accomplish? Nothing less than the redefinition of sex—and of pregnancy itself. The landmark 1972 law known as Title IX ensures that women and girls don’t face discrimination based on sex in school programs, including sports. The original language was simple, but it has grown into a regulatory nightmare. The Biden administration’s proposed revision of rules carrying out the law—which affects every K-12 school and institution of higher education that receives federal funding—is a whopping 700 pages. Our Heritage Foundation colleagues have sounded the alarm on how the proposed rule changes would undercut women’s athletics, undermine due process, impose woke sexual orthodoxy, and more. But what about pregnancy? To answer this question and hold the Biden administration accountable for the lives and flourishing of preborn babies, The Heritage Foundation examined what the proposed Title IX rule changes say about pregnancy and filed a public comment. Here’s a summary of what Heritage said: 1. Pregnancy is redefined to include abortion. The Biden administration wants to redefine pregnancy to include childbirth, lactation, and “termination of pregnancy”—that is, abortion. The administration’s three-pronged definition of pregnancy makes a notable departure from previous ones. Under Title IX now, women are protected from discrimination if they get an abortion. This means that with a doctor’s note, women receive medical leave from class or a sports team to recover. Abortion currently is a distinct issue that falls under “sex discrimination,” but under the Biden administration’s change, abortion would be included as an aspect of pregnancy. It’s a distinction that makes all the difference. The new definition would treat abortion as morally equal to pregnancy, childbearing, and lactation. This is absurd. Pregnancy is a natural process. A new life begins at the moment of conception. This human being is just that—a human being—at every stage of development. Lactation is the natural response of a mother’s body to the needs of her baby as she provides milk and essential nutrients for her newborn child. Abortion, in contrast, is the intentional, direct destruction of preborn human life. It kills the preborn baby and halts the natural process of pregnancy. In short, the proposed definition erroneously conflates pregnancy and lactation, a natural and lifegiving process, with abortion, an induced procedure intended to kill preborn life. 2. Creation of an abortion neutrality ‘gray zone.’ The Title IX statute includes an “abortion neutrality” provision saying that the policy doesn’t require a person or entity to pay for abortion nor does it prohibit that. Nor can a person be discriminated against for obtaining a legal abortion. But the abortion landscape changed dramatically June 24, when the Supreme Court corrected a grave error and overturned Roe v. Wade and abortion on demand in the case known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. No longer is abortion recognized as a so-called constitutional right. Abortion policy has returned to the American people and their elected representatives. While the high court’s 1973 ruling in Roe v. Wade was in effect, top-down national guidelines dictated state abortion law. This made interpretation of Title IX’s regulations easier to apply. Now, states have enacted—or are in the process of enacting—new policies that protect women and unborn children from abortion. By neither “requiring nor prohibiting” abortion access in schools, the language of the Title IX rule change would create a “gray zone.” This gray zone would mean that schools may “opt in” to use Title IX as a vehicle for abortion education, referrals, or access. This could take the form of connecting students with abortion clinics, not disclosing a pregnancy or abortion to a minor’s parents, paying for abortion travel, or promoting dangerous abortion pills. What if a K-12 school or college receives Title IX funding but is located in a state that protects mothers and preborn babies? The Department of Education doesn’t provide any insight into how the conflict between federal regulation and state law would be resolved. This isn’t a theoretical question. Abortion on demand is one of the Biden administration’s top priorities, regardless of state law. For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs just released an interim final rule regarding provision of abortion services at VA facilities. This rule contradicts both pro-life state protections and federal law. Title IX’s normalization—and apparent promotion—of abortion under the proposed rule, paired with the Dobbs decision, could give schools greater incentives to “opt in” to promote abortion. If the Biden administration is trying to use the VA to promote its pro-abortion agenda, the Department of Education likewise could use Title IX to subvert state law. 3. Title IX should focus on its original goal: protecting women and girls. Implementing Title IX should focus on providing women with a full understanding of their rights under the law. This includes flexibility and accommodations for pregnancy and motherhood, lactation rooms, and access to pregnancy care centers to help address needs. If Title IX and abortion access are viewed as necessary parts in the fight against sex discrimination, women and girls would receive the dangerous message that they “need” abortion to succeed. This is an erroneous view of sex discrimination. Instead, it was precisely because of a person’s biological sex that Title IX protected girls and women from athletic or academic discrimination. This way, women and men may fully embrace the demands of motherhood or fatherhood. For 50 years, Title IX has understood, respected, and protected the differences between men and women. It did not, as in this proposed rule change, try to erase altogether the distinction between male and female or pregnancy and abortion. Let’s be clear. Title IX doesn’t provide the Biden administration with the power or scope to rewrite the abortion policies of the states. Nor does Congress’ original intent in passing Title IX in 1972 suggest that it meant the law to be an avenue to promote abortion. Likewise, Title IX does not give the administration the power or scope to completely alleviate women of responsibility for the consequences of their sex. This is a fundamental biological reality: Sexual intercourse can result in pregnancy. Although Title IX protects women from discrimination if they receive an abortion, it does not encourage or stipulate a right to an abortion as a means of removing undue “barriers.” That was true in 1972, and it remains true half a century later. What’s next? It should take Biden administration officials many months to review and respond to the thousands of public comments criticizing its Title IX rule revisions. Will the administration walk back its effort to undermine Title IX? Or will it barrel ahead in this effort to erase the very women and girls that the law was designed to protect? We’ll know in time.

If the opinion is left to stand, it would open the door for those who consider themselves transgender and feel clinically distressed to receive public accommodations in bathrooms, locker rooms, prisons, same-sex housing, and more. U.S. Circuit Judge Diana Gribbon Motz of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals wrote the majority opinion for the divided three-judge panel in Williams v. Kincaid, holding that under the Americans with Disabilities Act, gender dysphoria is a “disability.” Judge Pamela Harris joined Motz’s opinion to form the majority. The ADA is a civil rights law that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in all areas of public life, including employment, education, transportation, and in places that are open to the general public (public accommodations). So, what is the practical impact of this decision? It means that those with gender dysphoria—an “incongruence between (someone’s) gender identity and assigned sex” that results in “clinically significant distress,” as the American Psychiatric Association defines it—are not only protected from discrimination because of that so-called disability, but they are entitled to reasonable accommodations for it. In the case of former Fairfax County, Virginia, prisoner Kesha Williams, that “reasonable accommodation” should have, according to the court, included sending Williams (a biological male) back into the women’s prison. Williams had filed a disability discrimination claim against various prison employees alleging mistreatment while incarcerated. However, in order to reach this conclusion, the majority had to clear one very big hurdle: the language of the ADA itself, which explicitly excludes: Because the statute clearly eliminates disability protections for “gender identity disorder,” Motz engaged in a contorted legal analysis to determine that gender dysphoria was not actually a gender identity disorder. To reach that conclusion, she did not look to the statute’s language at the time of its enactment, but to a much more recent change on gender-related psychiatric diagnoses—one not envisioned, anticipated, or incorporated by the ADA’s original drafters in 1990. Motz relied heavily on a change made by the American Psychiatric Association in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, or DSM-5, in 2013. The DSM-5 is the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals in the United States. At that time, the APA replaced “gender identity disorder” with “gender dysphoria.” Because the change focused the diagnosis on the distress that some people who consider themselves transgender experience (and for which they may seek psychiatric, medical, and surgical treatments) instead of on a desire to be a gender other than the one they were born to, Motz determined that such a change was good enough to stretch the ADA well beyond the limits of what Congress determined it ought to originally bear. She wrote: In sum: If you’re “distressed” about being transgender, then you’re entitled to all the accommodations you’d like in public life, whether in bathrooms, locker rooms, prisons, or same-sex housing. The illogical conclusion, of course, is that transgender individuals who might be perfectly at ease with their underlying biological sex are not entitled to accommodations at all. As to how this will play out in modern America, one thing is for sure: It will be messy. The court has not only established the possibility that employers, schools, prisons, hospitals, and other entities will have to make judgment calls on when an accommodation is required and when it isn’t, it also creates a loophole for those who consider themselves transgender who might want to demand future accommodations but who may not, in reality, experience any distress at all. In his well-reasoned dissent, Judge A. Marvin Quattlebaum pointed out that the case was really a matter of simple statutory construction, and that the majority’s ruling wasn’t supported by the law’s text when it was enacted. He wrote: While the decision only directly covers those entities within the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals (Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland, and West Virginia), the court’s opinion has fanned the flames of controversy over transgender rights on a greater scale. It is also a prime example of why textualism—the interpretation of the law based on the ordinary meaning of the words as they were understood at the time of the law’s enactment—matters.

The time spent on these blogs began to distort her self-perception. Eventually they led her to virtual haunts where her “friends” blamed her teenage angst on being born in the wrong body. Helena’s story is not an anomaly. Other detransitioners, such as Keira Bell and Grace Lidinsky-Smith, were also exposed to gender ideology online. Today, research shows that the majority of those who transition were persuaded to do so online through social media, blogs, and YouTube. The spike in teens using social media and identifying as transgender is no mere coincidence. Today’s teens have only ever known a digital world. New media—smartphones, social media, and the internet suffuse their waking hours. The ubiquity of such technology means that teens spend more of their lives behind screens than hanging out with friends, going out, or getting their driver’s licenses. On average, teens spend almost nine hours plugged in every single day. >>> The Left’s Goal of Creating a “New Generation of Drag Kids” Behind those screens, sexual and transgender content saturates the digital spaces where most teens hang out. A simple hashtag search will instantly load thousands of LGBTQ posts on the social media platform of choice. For example, on WattPad, a new social media platform, one search turns up over 4.5 million original story uploads. Or consider TikTok. A search for “top surgery” loads countless clips of young women flaunting mutilated chests with millions of views. None of this happens by chance. Digital spaces are ever more designed to promote sexual and transgender content. For years, Tumblr allowed adult content to its servers before changing its policies. Others, like Twitter, continue to allow pornography on their platforms. With respect to transgender content, TikTok updated its community guidelines this year so that \"anti-LGBTQ+ content” is no longer allowed. More recently, Twitter, which has long censored dissenters, has been deplatforming those who say transgender activism is “grooming.” Some platforms are even designed to hide youth’s activity from the watchful eye of their parents. Some online LGBTQ sites, such as Q chat space and LGBT Hotline chatrooms, allow youth to easily chat with LGBTQ strangers. If that wasn’t bad enough, these sites feature a “quick escape” button that hides the chat. Given the high rates of tech usage among teens and the ideologically motivated design of digital spaces, it’s no wonder more Gen Z’ers identify as trans compared to older generations. This is exactly what radical gender activists want. They have long championed access to pornographic content online as essential to the “queer ecosystem” and to LGBTQ youth “self-discovery.” This is why the Human Rights Campaign insists that teens need to have access to online spaces, where they “have privacy” to “find out more” about their gender. It’s also why GLAAD, another LGBT activist group, is pressuring social media platforms to adopt policies that protect trans content. And when it comes to parents, activists argue that a parent’s restriction of transgender and sexual content online is “rejecting behavior.” Ultimately, activists assert that ensuring minors’ access to transgender content online is vital for the mental health of “LGBT” youth. But nothing could be further from the truth. Increased social media usage and exposure to sexual content undermine teens’ mental health. A couple of recent studies have found that the more time teens spend behind screens or scrolling on social media, the more depressed and less satisfied with life they are. Other research shows that early exposure to sexual content is linked to poor mental health and life satisfaction. Internal research at Instagram even found that 6 percent of teen Instagram users who struggle with suicidal thoughts traced it back to the platform itself. Worse, promoting and protecting content that encourages gender transition can lead to irreversible harm. The chemical and surgical interventions used for gender transition cause health problems like cardiovascular disease, reduced bone density, and, ultimately, sterilization. They don’t even improve mental health in the long run: Those who surgically transition are 19 times more likely to commit suicide than their peers, and teen suicide rates are found to be higher in states where minors can access these interventions with greater ease. >>> Tech and Trans Confusion Decisions about what youth need to hear or see should not be made by Big Tech employees in Silicon Valley. Instead, parents, with the help of policymakers, should be better empowered to care and protect their kids online. Parents should consider steps they can take to protect kids online. For instance, they can keep kids off social media until they are older, encourage only public use of the internet, and use filters. Lawmakers can also help. Raising the minimum age for internet use (as the Child Online Privacy and Protection Act would do) may be one way to protect kids from online harms. Another step in the right direction would be to prohibit the sexual exploitation of minors and the promotion of content that poses risks to minors’ physical and mental health (which the Kids Online Safety Act would do). If we seek to protect kids online, we must guard against the harms of sexual and transgender content. Given the woke design of digital spaces, kids need protection online now more than ever. Lawmakers and parents both need to step up."},

California is now poised to become a super-spreader—and confused children and their parents across the country will be the victims. Gender dysphoria is a feeling of alienation between one's internal sense of \"gender\" and one's biological sex. Such feelings tend to resolve in 80 to 95 percent of kids if they are allowed to go through puberty unimpeded. But now, many kids are being fast-tracked to permanent body alterations called \"gender affirming care.\" This epidemic of the mind and spirit is not spread by contact or close quarters but by social media \"influencers\" and ideologues who have captured schools, medical groups, and state legislatures. In many states, teachers and government officials will encourage a child's claimed \"gender identity\"—whatever that child's sex—even behind parents' backs. This treatment often starts with changed names and pronouns. It may then move to experimental puberty blockers, then cross-sex hormones and sterilizing surgeries. Double mastectomies, castration, and hysterectomies are just the beginning of this medical parade of horribles. >>> On Offense Against Radical Gender Ideology These drugs and surgeries can cause severe pain; permanent sexual dysfunction; long-term damage to bones, heart, and blood circulation; and sterility. And there's no good evidence that they improve kids' mental and emotional health. Rather than face these facts squarely, some states, such as California, are now so far gone that parents can lose custody of their daughters and sons for resisting this effort to upend natural puberty. Instead of fighting this contagion, California's legislature wants to spread it to every state. Senate Bill 107 now sits on Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk. If it becomes law, California courts will have the power to strip custody from parents, wherever they live, who doubt the wisdom of these experimental and irreversible procedures—if their child so much as steps foot in California. The primary victims of this policy, of course, are the children. But it's also an egregious attack on parents' fundamental rights, which include the right to direct their child's mental and physical health care. This bill mandates that doctors conceal a child's medical information from parents if it is related to \"gender identity\" drugs and procedures, even if that information is sought under a court-issued subpoena. It would also allow California doctors to treat minors still in other states. With the advent of telehealth, a child could get a prescription for hormones from a California doctor while at home in Arkansas or in Florida. But the Arkansas legislature has passed a law to protect minors from the danger of cross-sex hormones. And the Florida Department of Health found that these procedures failed the strict standards we expect for medical care. This digital workaround violates both parents' rights and state authority. The U.S. Constitution's \"full faith and credit\" clause requires states to defer to each other's laws and jurisdictions. California is thumbing its nose at other states' authority and jurisdiction. Imagine the parental nightmares this California bill would unleash. A mother in Texas who has sole custody of her daughter could find her custody stripped by a California court who sides with an estranged father who takes the daughter to California to get puberty blockers. No family is off limits, and no court decision is safe, because California has decided that its courts—not those of the family's home state—should be the final deciders of whether parents are fit to raise their child. >>> The U.K. Cracks Down While the U.S. Doubles Down on “Gender Affirming” Care Worse, California is luring minors who believe they were born in the wrong body to abandon their families. The state legislature knew what it was doing. When SB107 was being debated, Californian Chloe Cole testified against it. She came down with an acute case of gender dysphoria as a 12-year-old. She found out the hard way that the promises of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and a double mastectomy at age 15 were lies. The California assembly didn't listen to Chloe. Nor did it consider the testimony of the growing army of physicians and scientists, as well medical authorities in the U.K., Sweden, and Finland, who question the value and ethics of \"gender affirming care.\" Parents from across the country are joining that army. Many have urged Governor Newsom to veto the bill before it goes into effect on Oct. 1. If he fails to do so, Americans must stand for the safety and well-being of their kids. That means working to preserve the fundamental rights of parents and the authority of their own states to protect those rights."},

When a Democrat occupies the White House, you can be reasonably sure that administrative agencies will start bending rules to get results that they can’t get through normal procedures. Witness, for example, the rise of the agency “guidance” document. These are documents that express an agency’s view of what the law is. They are not, however, formal rules that have the force of law. Still, any regulated entity would be foolish to ignore an agency guidance document because it knows the agency will enforce its new understanding of the law. The agency’s bureaucrats in charge of dishing out fines and other administrative penalties will treat the guidance as if it’s binding. Think of guidance not as a command, but as an implied threat. Yes, it’s not technically a rule that you have to follow, but if you don’t go along willingly, we’ll break your kneecaps … bureaucratically. A recent decision by U.S. District Judge Charles Atchley struck a blow against these shenanigans, and that’s a good thing. The guidance at issue in that case comprised several documents expressing the belief of the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that various laws prohibiting sex discrimination in schools and workplaces now guarantee that individuals who say they are transgender may use the bathrooms, showers, and dress codes of their choice. These laws can force others to refer to these individuals using their preferred personal pronouns. If you read the relevant anti-discrimination laws, you won’t find anything supporting this view, however. These agencies got the idea from the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, where the court held that Title VII (the federal law forbidding sex discrimination in employment) prohibits employers from firing employees based on their homosexuality or transgender status. But the court carefully limited that decision. In writing for the majority in Bostock, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote: The employers in that case were right to worry. President Joe Biden took that decision and ran with it. In his executive order of Jan. 20, 2021, his first day as president, he declared that “laws that prohibit sex discrimination … prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation,” and directed federal agencies to “fully implement” that expansive reinterpretation of the law. In the view of the Department of Education, Bostock applies to Title IX (which forbids sex discrimination in education), so that schools may be investigated and punished for having sex-specific bathrooms, dress codes, and sports teams. In the view of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Bostock also means that it is workplace sexual harassment to refer to a transgender employee by the wrong pronouns. These are aggressive readings of Bostock, but that’s not the key problem. The key problem is that the agencies introduced these new interpretations through guidance documents and in doing so skirted a law, called the Administrative Procedure Act, that requires them to comply with a careful and deliberative process before making big legal changes. The agencies claimed that they did not need to comply with the Administrative Procedure Act because the guidance was nonbinding. But Atchley saw through that deception. The Department of Education says that its document “will guide the department in processing complaints and conducting investigations.” And the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission invites people to file complaints against employers who violate the legal view set out in its guidance document. These are nonbinding documents in the same way that an armed robber’s “suggestion” that you hand over your wallet is nonbinding. Thankfully, several states sued claiming that these guidance documents are, in fact, subject to the Administrative Procedure Act. That would mean that the agencies had to make them available to public comment before issuing them, which the agencies did not do. In his ruling, Atchley said the states were likely to succeed on this claim. The guidance documents, he noted, were not truly nonbinding. By expanding the Supreme Court’s Bostock decision, the agencies had created new rights and obligations for students, schools, employees, and employers. The Biden administration had forced the states to choose between the threat of legal consequences—enforcement action, civil penalties, and the withholding of federal funding—or altering their own laws to ensure compliance with the agency guidance and avoid any adverse action, something Atchley called an “untenable” choice. Additionally, the Department of Education’s rule conflicts with the text of Title IX, where regulations expressly permit sex-separated bathrooms, locker rooms, and sports teams. Finally, the agencies have said that they would enforce these new interpretations. As such, they’re not mere suggestions, they’re de facto rules. And new rules must comply with the Administrative Procedure Act. The effect of the judge’s decision is to delay Biden’s aggressive efforts to eliminate protections for women and girls—at least until his new regulations are issued. Those regulations currently are under consideration at the Department of Education. But more importantly, Atchley has stood up for administrative accountability. So, how do you solve a problem like a rogue agency? Ideally, you pick a president who won’t tolerate bad administrative behavior. But failing that, you find a judge like Judge Charles Atchley, who will hold agencies to the law. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

Wade through its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a renewed conversation about abortion is front and center all across the country.  And rightfully so, because states will now be forced to confront the question of whether or not they will stand for life. While it’s important to ensure that life wins and abortion is forever in the history books, we must stand for life in another way as well: We need to help parents protect their children against the increased suicide rate among gender-confused young people due to cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers—euphemistically known as “gender-affirming care.” We’ve already seen that President Joe Biden and his administration are on the warpath against parents’ right to protect their children. The Justice Department recently sent a letter to all state attorneys general warning that they could be violating civil rights laws if their states keep minors from receiving that “gender-affirming care.” In addition, at a May 4 hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., asked Xavier Becerra, Biden’s secretary of health and human services, “In what case would it be inappropriate to perform irreversible sex-change surgery on kids?” Becerra responded: “Those decisions are made by that individual, and in consultation with a physician and caregiver.” And if you log on to the Department of Health and Human Services website and view the page dedicated to “gender-affirming care,” you find a word salad about how to support children struggling with gender dysphoria. But one of the glaring omissions from the Biden administration’s fight to make cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers more accessible to children facing gender dysphoria is this: Parents are hardly mentioned. So, how do they justify pushing these potentially harmful drugs on children without checking with parents? They claim there’s an increase in the suicide rate due to unchecked and unsupported depression. But on a recent episode of the “Heritage Explains” podcast, Heritage Foundation senior research fellow Jay Greene explained how that devastating narrative completely undermines the basic rights of parents. But Greene’s groundbreaking research flips that narrative on its head, showing that easing a minor’s ability to go around their parents to access cross-sex interventions is actually associated with a significant increase in adolescent suicides. “Rather than being protective against suicide, these drugs appear to be exacerbating young people committing suicide … and the increase is about 14% in annual suicide rates among young people,” he said. Greene found that because that increase is happening largely in the states where it is easier for minors to access drugs without parental consent, laws must be passed to ensure kids are protected and parents’ rights are clearly defined. In a recent message to commemorate so-called Transgender Visibility Day, Biden talked about and encouraged parents and children who are struggling to ask for help. Perhaps the best place to help is to end his administration’s push for “gender-affirming care,” and instead empower parents to seek the right answers for their family.

Yet neither the “progressive media” nor the Biden administration sees this as problematic. Thomas, a collegiate swimmer, declared to be a girl. The “woke” media wrapped him in praise when he exited the pool a Division I women’s champ earlier this year. The administration did more than cheer. It has been working feverishly to redefine “sex” in federal law as something you choose, rather than something you are born with. The administration’s most recent denial of biology comes from a proposal to interpret Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to mean that you cannot discriminate against someone based on what they decide is their “sexual orientation and gender identity” instead of their actual sex. >>> Biden’s New Title IX Rule Guts Protections for Women and Girls. Here’s How to Fight It. If the administration is successful, girls could find themselves in bathrooms with biological boys. Female athletes could face a much greater risk of injury from boys who say they are girls. Just ask the three young women hurt when body-slammed in a recent high school rugby match in Guam. Or, as in the Thomas example, girls could have their athletic achievements swiped away. Some state lawmakers have already moved to protect young children who face serious risks from radical ideas about assumed “genders.” Officials in states such as Florida and Tennessee have protected young girls by requiring boys to use boys’ bathrooms and locker rooms and compete on boys’ sports teams. But with the Thomas nomination making headlines and Washington rushing to abandon biology, many parents and teachers are asking: What happens now? Before the Biden administration can impose its anti-science definitions—definitions that disempower women—on the nation, it must first review thousands of public comments submitted in response to their proposal. This will force the administration to explain why it wants to take a federal law adopted 50 years ago to protect women and use it to put them at greater risk. There are legal questions, too. The chief attorneys from 21 states—nearly half of the U.S.—last year sued to block the proposed rule, arguing that the administration is trying to “go far beyond interpreting Title IX and instead seeks to rewrite it.” They noted that, by redefining “sex” to include the ambiguous idea of “gender,” the proposal actually “undermines rather than interprets” a key part of federal law that was meant to empower women. A federal judge has now ruled that Biden’s team cannot punish states that have already said boys must use boys’ bathrooms and compete on boys’ sports teams, stalling the administration’s radical agenda. And don’t expect state education leaders to sit idly by while Washington tries to put children at risk. For example, Louisiana State Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley recently went on record saying, “We shouldn’t discriminate against any children in any school,” but “I don’t think it’s appropriate for biological males to be in little girls’ bathrooms.” >>> Biden’s Push for “Gender-Affirming Care” Betrays Parental Rights Noting that the proposed rule that changes the definition of sex is still under consideration and not official, Brumley also wondered why the Biden administration is acting as though the change has already been approved. He notes that the U.S. Department of Agriculture is threatening to withhold money for school lunches for children from low-income families who are attending schools that do not allow boys to use girls’ bathrooms or do not force teachers to use pronouns that do not match a child’s sex. Thomas’ dreams of being named NCAA Woman of the Year collapsed Monday, when the honor was bestowed on an actual woman: Columbia University fencer Sylvie Binder. But President Biden still wants to cram radical ideas into our schools, ideas that assault a pillar of women’s rights: Title IX. Thankfully, his agenda has not one problem, but many: state officials around the U.S. who are defending children."},

Title IX was a part of the Education Amendments of 1972, and its prohibition is simple: But this simple law has provided a platform for a proposed rule from the Department of Education that is replete with problems. These problems, if left unaddressed, promise to fundamentally overhaul the state of American education as it exists today. The Department of Education signaled its rule change as far back as June 2021 with a Federal Notice of Interpretation of Title IX. It indicated that—based on the Supreme Court’s ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County in 2020—sex discrimination would be interpreted within Title IX to also include discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Applying this rationale to Title IX—erroneously, as I’ve previously written—removes the law’s intended protections for women and vitiates its very purpose. There are four chief problems with the new rule: 1. The proposed rule expands the definition of “sex” to include “gender identity.” What does this mean for American school girls and young women? It means that any K-12 school, college, or university receiving direct or indirect federal funding would have to open its bathrooms, locker rooms, housing accommodations, and any other sex-separated educational program or offering to someone who is biologically of the opposite sex. Such a dangerous rewriting of the rule sacrifices the safety, privacy, and equality of girls and women to appease a pet policy agenda, unsupported by necessity. It ignores the extensive congressional record on Title IX’s purpose and the law’s specific provision of separate spaces to protect the privacy and safety of girls and women—those for whom the law was passed. In a likely recognition that the issue of biological men joining women’s and girls sports teams doesn’t poll well, the Department of Education has said it “plans to issue a separate notice of proposed rulemaking to address whether and how the Department should amend the Title IX regulations to address students’ eligibility to participate on a particular male or female athletics team.” But the use of “whether” is illuminating. The department’s unwillingness to commit to a full-throated repudiation of biological men competing in women’s sports hints that the proposed rule perhaps already addresses the issue. Because it does. After expanding the term “sex” to include gender identity, the proposal goes on to state: Thus, the department has ensured that the sports issue will be decided in favor of biological men whether or not it engages in additional rule-making. New rule-making on sports is an empty promise: The Education Department is likely to find that there is “discrimination” when faced with Title IX discrimination complaints by so-called transgender athletes. Every. Time. 2. The proposed rule will eliminate due process protections for students accused of sexual harassment or sexual assault. After thorough consideration of over 124,000 public comments and in response to a growing crisis of sexual violence in education, the department under the previous administration issued a Title IX rule in 2020 that clarified that sexual harassment, including sexual assault, constituted unlawful sex discrimination. That rule provided important provisions ensuring due process in campus Title IX grievance proceedings that protect free speech and academic freedom. Among other things, the 2020 rule requires colleges to provide live hearings and allow both the accused and complainant student’s advisers to cross-examine parties and witnesses involved. Institutions must also presume that those accused of sexual misconduct are innocent prior to the investigative and decision-making process. But President Joe Biden’s proposed rule rolls back the 2020 protections, leaving schools with a “guilty until proven innocent” presumption for those accused of harassment or assault, virtually guaranteeing the wrongful punishment of innocent people. Expulsion from school, loss of scholarships and financial aid, and reputational harm for the wrongfully accused can and will dramatically change the trajectory of an individual’s life and career. 3. The proposed rule will install a “heckler’s veto” at schools that are federally funded by forcing students, teachers, and professors to toe the line on a woke, sexual orthodoxy or be faced with a Title IX federal complaint. Title IX complaints filed by hypersensitive students claiming to have felt sexually harassed by otherwise innocent speech made by professors and students were rising prior to the department’s 2020 rule. Currently, campus speech—such as discussion of sexual issues—is not considered harassing just because it is “pervasive”; and let’s face it, debates and discussions about sex and gender tend to be fairly pervasive on college campuses. To constitute verbal sexual harassment, the speech must not only be pervasive, it must also be severe enough in nature to deny or limit a “person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s education program or activity.” But the Biden administration is hoping to change that. Its new Title IX rule would discard the current definition of verbal sexual harassment used by the Education Department, which is based on a 1999 Supreme Court decision. Instead, it would redefine sexual harassment more broadly in schools and universities to restrict speech that some courts have ruled is protected by the First Amendment. It would do that by revising its definition of sexual harassment to cover behavior that is deemed either pervasive or severe—but it wouldn’t need to be both. In fact, as recently as this year, a student group—Speech First—challenged the Title IX harassment policy at the University of Central Florida in federal court because it imperiled the students’ ability to share their views with progressive classmates who might be offended by their speech. As the federal appeals court noted, “Among the views that Speech First’s members have said they want to advocate,” but fear punishment for expressing, were “that the government ‘should not be able to force religious organizations to recognize marriages with which they disagree,’” and that “a man cannot become a woman because he ‘feels’ like one.” The fact that these statements, which are protected by the First Amendment, could “qualify for prohibition” under a harassment definition shows that such a definition “is staggeringly broad,” said the court in its ruling against the University of Central Florida. The Biden administration has clarified that it will define verbal “harassment”—which schools and colleges must punish under the proposed rule—as any “unwelcome sex-based conduct that is sufficiently severe or pervasive, that, based on the totality of the circumstances and evaluated subjectively and objectively, denies or limits a person’s ability to participate in or benefit from the recipient’s education program or activity (i.e., creates a hostile environment).” But its use of the term “hostile environment” does nothing to limit its reach or protect free speech. Under schools’ “hostile environment” harassment codes, students and campus newspapers have been charged with racial or sexual harassment for expressing commonplace views about racial or sexual subjects, such as when they have criticized feminism, racial preferences, sexual harassment regulations, homosexuality, gay marriage, or transgender rights, or discussed the alleged racism of the criminal justice system. Whether it’s the filing of spurious Title IX complaints to remove undesirable voices from campus or forcing de facto speech codes into classroom instruction, the mind reels at the many possible abuses of the Title IX investigation process to chill free speech on campus. 4. The proposed rule quietly removes protections for religious institutions that adhere to a traditional belief on sexuality, gender, and marriage by eliminating previous protections that were reaffirmed as recently as 2020. When the Obama administration issued guidance in 2010 that included LGBTQ people within Title IX’s sex discrimination definitions, many religious schools began to seek Title IX’s statutory religious exemption. These institutions saw the writing on the wall with the Obama administration’s aggressive expansion of Title IX’s application and sought assurances they wouldn’t be forced—in violation of their sincerely held religious tenets and teachings—to hire same-sex couples who live together openly, to open single-sex dorms to members of the opposite sex, or to fling wide their bathrooms for individuals whose subjective self-gender identity runs counter to their biology. In 2019, two students married to same-sex partners sued Fuller Theological Seminary, which had expelled them for violating its sexual standards policy. Although a federal court agreed in principle that Title IX covered LGBTQ persons, it sustained the religious exemption claim and dismissed the complaint. The long-standing religious exemption was reaffirmed in the 2020 Title IX regulation that states in pertinent part: Yet even though Title IX’s religious exemption is firmly grounded in statutes, regulations, and judicial decisions, the recent draft Title IX regulation from the Biden administration removes the religious protections without providing any justification for the proposed change. Conclusion With its new Title IX rule, the Biden administration is pursuing a radical agenda and proposing a change to our laws and to our educational system that will do irreversible and long-lasting harm to women, girls, the wrongly accused, our faith institutions, and freedom of speech. With such a transformative proposal under consideration, it’s imperative that citizens take action to defeat it. The sister organization of The Heritage Foundation that helps citizens keep government accountable—Heritage Action for America—has created a toolkit for the American public to use in pushing back against a rule that will affect nearly every student in America. The kit includes sample tweets, highlights of the rule, and more. Find that toolkit here. Under federal law, the Department of Education is required to take written comments from the public into consideration when promulgating a new rule of any kind. The public comment period on its new Title IX rule closes on Sept. 12. Comments can be submitted here. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

For years, the Academy has been a booster for the school-to-sterilization-pipeline for kids struggling with their sexed bodies—to the dismay of at least some of its 67,000 members. Of course, the American Academy of Pediatrics and other partisans camouflage the harsh bits of that pipeline. They refer to everything from social transition and puberty blockers to cross sex hormones and sterilizing surgery as “gender affirming care.” Its 2018 policy statement is, in effect, a catechism for this approach. But in a telling letter to the Wall Street Journal this week, the group seemed to signal a shift in its position. Over the last few weeks, the group has suffered some bad press and may have decided that its preferred term of art needs an update. Bad Press Spillover Some of the bad press has been spill over from Boston Children’s Hospital. Recently, this hospital, a pioneer in applying the methods championed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, put a series of short explainer videos on its YouTube channel. The videos, set to soothing music, feature talking heads describing services such as breast removal and the surgical fashioning of penile and vaginal simulacra. The former requires the harvesting of skin from the forearm or thigh of the patient. The latter demands daily balloon dilation inside the “neovagina” for the rest of the patient’s life. Note: This is a hospital for children. The videos went viral on social media with help from activist Chris Elston, viral Twitter account Libs of Tiktok, journalist Colin Wright, and many others. Boston Children’s and its media acolytes tried to claim that the hospital didn’t really do gender surgeries on minors. That wasn’t true, as news sources such as the Daily Caller pointed out. The hospital, as The Post Millennial  reported, “allowed vaginoplasties on 17-year-old males, phalloplasties on 18-year-old females, and double mastectomies for 15-year-olds.” Thus exposed, Boston Children’s did what any self-interested business would do: It claimed it was getting death threats from haters. It also edited the text on its website. (Just little tweaks, such as changing “17” to “18” when referring to the age of eligible patients.) And it pulled all the videos off its YouTube page. A High Profile Shot Across the Bow With this as background, Julia Mason and Leor Sapir published a piece in the Wall Street Journal on the American Academy of Pediatrics’ “Dubious Transgender Science,” as the headline declared. They detailed the whopping errors in a study by Jack Turban published in the Academy journal Pediatrics (and dismantled online by friends and critics in a matter of days.) Mason and Sapir noted that countries such as the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Finland have begun to have second thoughts about the “gender-affirming” protocol. Finally, Mason and Sapir laid out the evidence that the American Academy of Pediatrics leaders have suppressed debate among its members on the scientific merits of these treatments. Instead, those leaders have published “shoddy but politically correct” research to push their party line on gender surgery. Damage Control This critique in the Wall Street Journal provoked a response from Academy president Moira Szilagyi. Her response makes heavy use of the all-purpose euphemism “gender affirming care.” But it includes this claim: Is this a policy shift for the Academy? The Society for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine thinks so. In a tweet, the group says that the statement “realigns the AAP with Sweden, Finland and the UK’s new cautious stance.” The Society goes on to call for the Academy to “to update its guidelines accordingly and articulate the alternative treatment paths including the role of exploratory psychotherapy.” That would be a cause for celebration. But I suspect the American Academy of Pediatrics is just doing damage control. Rather than repenting, its leaders are trying to obscure the meaning of the phrase “gender affirming care.” That phrase is short for the “gender affirming care model.” It is the official term used to refer to the social transition-to-surgery pathway. That’s how the Academy has deployed it. And that’s how the current Department of Health and Human Services defines it. This model is meant to contrast with talk therapy to help kids reconcile their feelings with their bodies. Partisans of “gender-affirming care,” like the Academy, disparage this alternative as “conversion therapy.” It makes sense that the American Academy of Pediatrics would seek to obscure the dark truth of “gender-affirming care” and imply that it has little to do with genital surgery for minors. But even if, contrary to fact, no kids received genital surgery until their eighteenth birthday, gender-affirming care for troubled teens ends with sterility and lifelong drugs. It starts with preferred pronouns and puberty blockers. Indeed, puberty blockers, as the name implies, are given to kids who haven’t yet started puberty. Youth who enter the mouth of the pipeline tend not to get out the other side with their genitals and fertility intact. Candice Jackson, former acting assistant secretary for civil rights at the Department of Education, summed up this point nicely: “‘Social transition’ is the gateway to ‘gender drugs & surgeries.’” For year, the American Academy of Pediatrics has been a leading U.S. cheerleader of this medical model for teens, a model marketed and practiced by hospitals such as Boston Children’s. I fear it’s going to take far more than a few weeks of bad PR to get the Academy to change course. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

Health officials in the United Kingdom are acknowledging the damage being done by pushing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones onto children at exactly the same time as the Biden administration is demanding that education and health professionals endorse these “affirmative” treatments or face penalties. The contrast between the direction of gender-related policies in the United States and the U.K. could not be starker. The U.K. is shuttering its sole “gender clinic,” Tavistock, following a comprehensive review, while the U.S. is opening scores of new gender clinics, following the refusal of the American Academy of Pediatrics to conduct a review of the evidence. The U.K., along with other European countries, started widespread use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for children identifying as transgender almost a decade before clinics opened in the U.S. for the same purpose. With that extra decade of experience, European health officials have accumulated more evidence of the long-term damage being done and have started to reverse course. The U.K. review led by Dr. Hilary Cass, the former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, noted that gender clinic “staff have told us that they feel under pressure to adopt an unquestioning affirmative approach…” in which children’s claims about gender dysphoria are not carefully examined and underlying mental health issues are not properly addressed before prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. The review also expressed concern about the gross over-representation of girls and children on the autism spectrum being recommended for puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. If the rise in prescribing these drugs were simply a matter of children feeling freer to express their true selves, rather than the result of social contagion and recruitment among vulnerable groups, then those treated would better reflect the broader population. It is increasingly clear that we are witnessing a dangerous craze among children with mental health challenges rather than the liberation of the sexually oppressed. When these kinds of dangerous crazes manifested themselves in the past in the form of eating disorders or cutting, responsible adults and health officials recognized the problem and coordinated their responses to address the underlying depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. No one thought to “affirm” these children for expressing their true malnourished or scarred selves. But that is precisely what school and health officials in the U.S. are doing right now as they mistreat children with gender dysphoria. The pressure to “affirm” expressions of gender identity and prescribe drugs rather than address underlying mental health issues is resulting in a dramatic increase in youth suicide in the U.S. I was able to examine a natural policy experiment that resulted from some states having an extra barrier to children accessing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones by requiring parental consent while other states allowed exceptions. There was no difference in youth suicide rates between these different kinds of states prior to 2010, when clinics began to open across the U.S. to prescribe puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. After 2010, however, the youth suicide rate spiked in states that lacked the parental consent barrier, resulting in a 14 percent increase in suicide rates in those states relative to states that required parental consent. The U.S. needs to follow the example being set by the U.K. and other European countries by reversing the rush to put large numbers of girls and children with autism on puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. If the Biden Administration is determined to step on the accelerator, governors and state legislatures can pump the brakes by raising minimum ages for who can receive these treatments and imposing stricter liability on practitioners who place children’s life, health, and fertility at risk. State policymakers and school officials can also pump the brakes on “social transition” in which children change their names and pronouns, which is often the gateway to the “medical transition” of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and eventually surgeries. State laws should ban schools from using names or pronouns for children that differ from those listed on their birth records without the written permission of the parents. Such a ban would prevent school staff from facilitating social transition in secret from parents and without their consent. We need all of the responsible adults—parents, school staff, doctors, and policymakers—working together to recognize and address the underlying mental health issues children are experiencing. When education and health professionals rush children onto life-altering medication, and either deceive or coerce parents to get on board, we see the kinds of disasters that forced the U.K. to shutter its national gender clinic. Let’s hope the U.S. can learn this lesson without having to produce another decade of damage. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

Now extended across the whole month of June, it looks more like an effort designed to do the opposite. Last weekend, social media abounded with videos of a Pride event at a gay bar in Dallas called Drag the Kids to Pride. Young children can be seen handing money to twerking drag queens. A bright pink neon sign saying “It’s Not Going to Lick Itself!” added an extra layer of creepiness. This week, the Twitter account Libs of Tiktok alerted followers to a drag show at a San Francisco middle school. In one video, a crowd of students cheers wildly as the performer—Twitter handle @NickiJizz—pulls off his wig in the finale. Visceral outrage at sexualizing young kids is the right response—and there’s plenty of outrage online. But as radio host and writer Michael Brown has pointed out, the spectacle of drag queens performing for kids (and their parents) has been common at Pride parades for almost two decades. There was little public outcry beyond conservative circles. This year, however, the pushback seems stronger and more diverse than in previous years. What accounts for that? For one thing, the sexualization of young kids seems to have moved from the fringe to the mainstream. It’s not just in random gay bars and schools in San Francisco. It now seems to be official policy. For instance, as The Daily Signal reports, the Smithsonian American Art Museum has gotten in on the action. As part of its Pride Family Day, the taxpayer-supported museum sponsored “what it called an ‘age appropriate’ drag queen show and crafts inspired by the LGBTQ Pride flag for children ages 3 and up.” You can find “age-appropriate drag queen” listed in the dictionary of oxymorons not far from “female penis.” Second, Pride now seems less about gay and lesbian inclusion and more about abolishing the difference between males and females, and between adults and children. You can detect this shift even in presidential announcements. In 1998 and 1999, President Bill Clinton declared June to be “Gay and Lesbian Pride Month.” President Barack Obama did the same every year he was in office, but with a twist. He added the “T” to the “LGB.” “LGBT” now rolls smoothly off the tongue. But it denotes a strange coalition. “L” refers to females who are attracted to females. “G” refers to males attracted to males. “B” stands for bisexual—which implies that there are two sexes. “T,” in contrast, refers to those who seek to replace the binary of male and female with a subjective and fluid spectrum of “gender identity” independent of the body. Not to be outdone, President Joe Biden already has extended the celebration to infinity and beyond with “LGBTQ+ Pride Month.” “Q+” apparently includes gender identity lessons and sexed-up drag queen burlesque shows for 5-year-olds. Somewhere between the “B” and the plus sign, Pride Month jumped the shark. This targeting of children gives the sea of rainbows a much more sinister hue. The pride-signaling on corporate logos, map and exercise apps, public school hallways, TV networks and streaming services, Google doodles, even on Major League Baseball fields and jerseys, feels ever more oppressive. This rainbow-fest has irked social conservatives for years. And some feminists have objected to drag queens, which are little more than men dressing up as sexualized parodies of women. But now, even some who identify as gay and lesbian have had enough. On Twitter, Storm Robinson observed: “As a gay man, I can’t understand why a parent would take their child to a drag queen story hour. Why does this even exist? … Drag is not for kids. The end.” And consider British philosopher Kathleen Stock, author of the terrific book “Material Girls,” who was marching in Pride parades just a few years ago. She now has harsh words about the whole business: But the most quotable takedowns have come from Candice Jackson on Twitter. In one representative tweet, she says that “‘LGBTQ Pride’ is a spiritual cult that’s anti-reality, anti-civil liberties, targeting children for fantasy-based rites of body sacrifice to liberate ‘gender souls’ & ‘queer’ sexualization.” It’s hard to improve on that.

"], "text": "When faced with divisive political arguments, the Left has a bad habit of putting on its figurative lab coat, conducting lousy research, and then declaring that Science has resolved the dispute in its favor. This tendency was on full display during the pandemic: If you didn’t obey faux-scientific orders on masks, social-distancing, or school closures, you must have wanted people to die. This political abuse of science is emerging again on the issue of gender dysphoria in adolescents. The Biden administration and its allies are declaring that if “gender-affirming” care in the form of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones is not widely and readily available to trans-identifying children, young people trapped in bodies that do not conform with their declared sex will despair and commit suicide. Recently, former White House spokesperson Jen Psaki reacted to an Alabama law that restricts prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones to minors as interfering with “medically necessary, life-saving healthcare.” These comments echo those of advocates like Sarah Harte, who declared that “laws and systems barring gender-affirming healthcare will contribute to higher rates of significant mental health problems, including deaths by suicide.” State policymakers in California, Washington, and elsewhere are responding to laws, such as the one in Alabama, by advancing legislation that makes puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones more accessible young. >>> Puberty Blockers, Cross-Sex Hormones, and Youth Suicide But–déjà vu–the science used to justify these claims and policy changes is extremely weak. Only a handful of studies examine the relationship between cross-sex hormone treatments and suicide risks that compare outcomes for teenagers who received such care to those who sought it but did not receive it. No study uses a causal research design, such as a randomized controlled trial, which is typically required for approving drugs. Instead, many of these studies compare minors who received interventions to those who were unable to get them and find lower rates of contemplating suicide. There are many defects in this research. First, these studies rely upon surveys of trans-identifying adults recruited from trans support and advocacy groups, so they are not representative of all people who have experienced gender dysphoria as adolescents. In particular, these studies are less likely to include people who resolved these issues without medical intervention and people who had regret about receiving puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. In addition, comparing of people who sought and received puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones with those unable to receive them doesn’t give the full picture. One of the requirements for receiving these interventions is being labeled as psychologically stable. So the fact that, suicidal ideation is higher among people who tried but could not get these drugs may be the result of their being disqualified because they were psychologically unstable when they sought them. And existing studies make no effort to control for prior mental health conditions. In a new report released by the Heritage Foundation, we conduct a more rigorous examination of this issue. We find that easing access to cross-sex treatments without parental consent significantly increases suicide rates. We take advantage of a natural policy experiment that results from the fact that some states have a legal provision that allows minors to access medical care without parental consent, at least under certain circumstances, while other states have no such provision. This variation in state policies pre-dates the introduction of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones as medical interventions, which began in the U.S. around 2010 and accelerated around 2015. We compare annual youth suicide rates in states that allow minors to access care without parental consent to states that do not. The data clearly show no difference in youth suicide rates between these two groups of states for over a decade before 2010, when this use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones begins. Around that time, a difference in suicide rates emerges and the gap accelerates after 2015 when cross-sex treatments become more common. >>> Gender Curriculum Coming to a Classroom Near You There is a 14% increase in suicide rates among young people by 2020 in states that have a provision allowing minors to access care without parental consent relative to states that do not. Easier access to puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones by minors actually exacerbated suicide rates. Importantly, we do not observe any difference between these groups of states in the suicide rates among young adults who would be unaffected by policies that facilitate cross-sex drugs for minors. Suicide rates accelerate only among young people who could be affected by policies easing access to these drugs. The relative increase in suicide rates only occurs after cross-sex treatments are introduced, and the trajectory of the increase matches the prevalence of these interventions. Given these elevated suicide risks, state and federal governments should reverse the push to make puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones more widely and readily available to minors. We find that facilitating access to these treatments without parental consent is particularly dangerous. This suggests that lawmakers  should instead adopt a parental bill of rights to ensure that parents are informed and involved in these critical decisions about their own children. Despite what left-leaning activists may tell us, science does not demonstrate that puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones are necessary to prevent suicides. In fact, if anything, it demonstrates the opposite."},

The U.S. Agency for International Development is supposed to use U.S. foreign assistance funds to “advance a free, peaceful, and prosperous world.” Its stated goals—saving lives, reducing poverty, and helping people progress beyond the need for assistance—are noble and uncontroversial. Packaging our foreign aid in the language and ideology of radical gender theory, however, is not. This new gender policy at USAID is the latest manifestation of President Joe Biden’s plan to make gender ideology a central theme of government policy—and there’s a lot of money to set aside to do it. USAID’s budget request for fiscal year  2023 is $60.4 billion. That’s up 6% over last year, and includes an extra $2.6 billion to push the National Strategy on Gender Equity and Equality. Gender ideology offends many of our needy foreign aid recipients. Putting such ideological shackles on our aid undermines the goodwill that our assistance would otherwise garner. It perpetuates the notion that Americans see other cultures as morally inferior, and that we use our aid to “improve” their cultures. This is naked ideological colonialism. Equity vs. Equality A “gender equality and women’s empowerment” policy should seek to empower women and girls, to help them have more chances to exercise their rights on par with men and boys. But the new USAID gender policy instead emphasizes the idea of “gender equity.” USAID defines gender equity as “the process of ensuring women and men, boys and girls, and gender diverse individuals receive consistent, systematic, fair, and just treatment and distribution of benefits and resources.” It even goes on to call for measures “to compensate for historic and systemic disadvantages.” That’s a far cry from equality. And it’s neither a proper nor achievable goal for the U.S. government. No amount of foreign assistance will yield equal outcomes for any groups or individuals in other countries. Instead, USAID ought to return to the definition of “gender equality” that it employed in its previous policy: “The state in which women, girls, men, and boys have equal access to opportunities, resources, benefits, and legal protections, and which recognizes their equal, inherent human dignity, worth and unalienable rights.” More Absurd Definitions In the new draft policy, USAID departs from a perennial, science-based understanding of sex and from the common usage of “gender” as synonymous with biological sex. Instead, the terms in its glossary are controversial and nebulous. It acknowledges as much by stating that “language is dynamic and evolving.” The document is replete with terms such as “gender binary,” “gender diverse,” and “gender identity,” which refer to nothing more than subjective feelings or artificial labels. Not only is this language insensitive to other cultures, barely disguising an ideological agenda, but it’s also nonsensical. There’s no neutral, empirical way to discern a “gender identity.” As a concept, “gender identity” is an artifact of gender theory, not history or science. It should not be governing our foreign policy or aid programming. Erasing Women USAID’s consistent use of the phrase “women and girls in all their diversity” stretches the definition of “women and girls” to the point of including anyone, even men and boys. By defining that term to include “the full range of gender identity and/or gender expression, sex characteristics, sexual orientation, and other intersectional characteristics,” it detracts from focusing on needs or conditions unique to women. For example, a man who claims to “identify” as a woman does not have the same needs or challenges as a woman—a biological female—in the context, for example, of menstrual health and hygiene. A USAID grant or program ought to recognize and address that reality. Not only does the new policy add radical and counterproductive elements, but it took important content out. Motherhood is a glaring omission in a document that purports to be concerned with women and girls. Millions of women who benefit from USAID programs are mothers, and happily so. Motherhood is a defining part of these women’s lives. U.S. policy should acknowledge and support the critical role that mothers make to a productive and peaceful society. Radicalizing Next Generation USAID’s emphasis on “gender-transformative education” is another example of overt ideological imperialism. According to the document, the aim of gender-transformative education is to “transform stereotypes, attitudes, norms, and practices.” It does so “by challenging power relations, rethinking gender norms and binaries, and raising critical consciousness about the root causes of inequality and systems of oppression.” USAID holds this type of education up as worthy of support. But changing cultural attitudes and raising awareness of oppression is not what parents want for their children. They want better reading, math, and science. Under Biden, the U.S. is exporting a tendentious ideological fixation of a disproportionately powerful special interest into the developing world. This is especially tone-deaf in U.S. government dealings with countries that do not share the Biden administration’s left-wing worldview. Remember this the next time the liberal news media complain about the U.S. “standing” in the world.

"], "text": "For a brief moment last week, President Joe Biden’s administration appeared to be interested in what parents think about K-12 schools. Low student achievement coming out of the pandemic. High rates of depression among youth. School officials hiding information about students’ health from their parents. The administration seemed to be aware of these concerns when it announced the creation of a National Parents and Families Engagement Council to “facilitate strong and effective relationships between schools and parents.” But just when we thought this administration was ready to apologize for, say, intimidating parents who voice their opinions at school board meetings, astute observers noticed that the new council actually included groups complicit with such intimidation. Last fall, the administration coordinated with the National School Boards Association for the association to release a letter saying that federal officials should investigate parents who speak up at local school board meetings. The letter called for agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation to review the potential for any “enforceable actions” against those making public comments at these meetings. But as Parents Defending Education’s Erika Sanzi notes, a group called the National Parents Union also supported the letter and is now a founding member of the new so-called parents council. So, is the White House bringing parents together to listen to them or to try to convince them to support Biden’s policies? The announcement about the parent council was just days old when the administration made yet another charge at “protecting families.” This time, though, the administration did not even try to hide the coercion. On June 15, Biden issued an executive order on “advancing equality for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex individuals.” The order states that the secretaries of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Education would be releasing model state legislation in the coming months to support the “rights” of these individuals. Model legislation from Washington is not even necessary for us to know the administration’s position at this point—federal officials have made it clear that existing federal and state laws will not stop them from replacing “sex” with “sexual orientation and gender identity” anywhere they see it. To justify this act of executive fiat, they must misinterpret the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton County. In May, the administration did something that offered a peek at what may come in a model bill: Federal officials skipped over Congress and any rule-making processes and are threatening to withhold federal school lunches from low-income children in schools where boys are not allowed to participate in girls sports or access girls bathrooms. The executive order says there have been “unrelenting political and legislative attacks at the State level … on LGBTQI+ children and families in particular.” This sounds like a reference to state policies that require educators to include parents in discussions and intervention plans for children who are depressed, anxious, and confused about their sex—three conditions often found together in children caught up in the “transgender” movement. Parents should be at the center of conversations with their children about their sexuality. Some state agencies, however, have adopted policies that prohibit teachers from telling parents when a child is confused about his or her sex. In response, lawmakers in other states, such as Florida, have adopted policies that say parents must be part of any health or medical decisions made regarding their school-aged children. State policymakers around the country are considering similar “parents’ bills of rights.” The provisions in these parents’ bills of rights do not conform to the Biden administration’s advocacy for radical “gender” policies and the efforts to hide information about children from their parents. The forthcoming federal model legislation for states is the administration’s response to states that are reinforcing parents’ roles as the students’ primary caregivers. Washington’s signals that it is interested in children and families disappeared this week in a cloud of advocacy for these radical policies. Individuals—including minor-age children—who are struggling with their sexual identity deserve empathy and compassion. Parents and family are necessary parts of such responses. Research finds that nearly all cases of youth gender dysphoria resolve as long as kids are not fast-tracked into “transitioning” to appear as the opposite sex with puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. Despite the talk of “parent councils” and “protecting families,” the Biden White House wants to force a radical gender agenda on young minds and limit parents’ power to stop it.

The Education Department released a 700-page document Thursday announcing the proposed changes to Title IX regulations. Perhaps most significantly, the changes would extend the prohibition of discrimination based on sex to include sexual orientation and gender identity. It’s amazing how at this stage in the history of our republic, sweeping national social and political changes increasingly are made by bureaucratic decree. The result of the Title IX changes effectively would force all schools that receive federal funding—from K-12 schools to colleges and universities—to conform to a radical version of gender ideology, or else. Here’s how Sarah Parshall Perry, a legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, parent organization of The Daily Signal, describes the effect of the rule change: The Biden administration made it clear that it intends to go after schools that don’t comply. The Department of Agriculture announced last month that it would direct state agencies and Food and Nutrition Act program operators to review their procedures to ensure that “complaints alleging discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation are processed and evaluated as complaints of discrimination on the basis of sex.” What this means is that the Biden administration effectively is threatening to take away school lunch benefits—intended to feed children of the poor—from schools that don’t comply with the new rules. The rule change also adds sections redefining sexual harassment to include “sex-based harassment.” This means that, for instance, using the “wrong” personal pronouns for a person identifying as the opposite sex could be considered sexual harassment. It’s almost surely a violation of the First Amendment right to free speech. Title IX has been used before to bludgeon free speech. In 2015, a Northwestern University professor triggered a Title IX investigation because he wrote an essay and sent tweets that offended a few students. The Trump administration, citing Supreme Court precedent, curtailed this Title IX power, but the Biden Education Department’s new regulations put it in on steroids. The new regulations also would empower K-12 schools to encourage students to go through a gender transition without parental consent, a policy that, according to research, already significantly increases suicide rates among young people. Schools, if they wish to continue receiving federal money, can’t prevent biological males from using women’s locker rooms or restrooms or from joining sororities. The change effectively ends the concept of female-only spaces in educational institutions. As Jennifer C. Braceras and Inez Stepman (my wife) wrote recently in The Wall Street Journal: “Out of a single sentence barring discrimination on the basis of sex, the Biden administration is illegally rewriting federal law to erase women and undermine constitutional liberties.” Although it’s true that many schools have gone far down the road of the new gender ideology, Biden’s Title IX changes effectively would nationalize the trend. For instance, once the administration’s related rule changes for sports come down, debates about whether biological boys and men can compete with girls and women in sports would be essentially ended by fiat. This despite most polls showing that the vast majority of Americans oppose allowing biological males to compete in women’s sports. Interestingly, the administration delayed applying Thursday’s Title IX rule change to sports on behalf of self-described transgender athletes and said this particular regulation will come later. It’s hard not to see the postponement, presumably until after the midterm elections in November, as more than an attempt to dodge immediate political consequences. The demolition of women’s sports is coming whether you like it or not. They know you probably won’t like it, so they will do what they can to avoid electoral consequences. What enlightened policymaking. It’s somewhat ironic that a law designed to increase access to sports for girls and women could be transformed to mandate that men be allowed to invade and derail their genuine competitions and possibly put the health and safety of girls and women at risk. A recent report in The Washington Stand found that biological males have won 28 college women’s sports titles since 2003, mostly in the past few years. There also has been a big increase in biological males’ taking second- and third-place trophies. Once the additional regulations come down, the floodgates will be open. Although legal challenges to these Title IX changes inevitably will come, the moves demonstrate the lengths to which the Biden administration will go to enforce its radical social agenda. National Public Radio ran an article celebrating Title IX’s 50th anniversary with this headline: “Benching the Patriarchy: 50 Years of Title IX and How 4 Women Fought for Change.” But if the Biden administration gets its way, in 2022 the patriarchy benches you.

Wade, the reinforcement of the Second Amendment and the triumphs for the free exercise of religion, free speech and school choice. But not all is on the right track. On its 50th anniversary, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972—the pinnacle achievement of sex equality in education—took a massive hit. Even as the Supreme Court delivered landmark opinion upon landmark opinion, the U.S. Department of Education issued a new rule on Title IX redefining “women” and proposing to undo many of the law’s successes. Once considered a feminist triumph, Title IX was enacted to prevent sex-based discrimination at any educational institution receiving federal funding. For hundreds of thousands of women, it has opened the door to graduate schools, scholastic sports, study programs and, ultimately, professional achievement. The rate of female participation in high school athletics is now 10 times what it was in 1972. Women now constitute over 56% of America’s college students. And they hold nearly half of all tenure-track teaching positions. >>> By Inserting Gender Identity, Team Biden Muddies Title IX’s Protections for Girls, Women at School But on the law’s golden anniversary, and in a twist of nearly Shakespearean tragedy, the Biden administration redefined womanhood in the very law passed for women’s advancement and protection. In its 701-page proposed Title IX regulation, the Department of Education has expanded the term “sex”—plain, unambiguous and understood by the 1972 ratifiers to mean biological distinctions between men and women—to include “sexual orientation and gender identity.” Seeking to advance his pet policy agenda on transgender ideology, the president has in one swift move made a mockery of the women’s liberation movement and the achievements of women everywhere. While the media fixates on protests over a woman’s “right” to obtain an abortion, a woman’s right to equal protection in education is on the line. By redefining “sex” to include “gender identity,” the administration has opened sex-segregated spaces like bathrooms, locker rooms, dorm rooms and single-sex admissions programs to anyone who identifies as a woman, regardless of that individual’s biology. But in what can only be seen as his recognition of the issue’s abysmal polling, President Biden has separated out the controversial trans-inclusive athletic issue. The Education Department “plans to issue a separate notice of proposed rulemaking to address whether and how the Department should amend the Title IX regulations to address students’ eligibility to participate on a particular male or female athletics team,” it wrote. The use of “whether” is illuminating. The department’s unwillingness to commit to a full-throated repudiation of men competing in women’s sports hints that the proposed rule perhaps already addresses the issue. Because it does. After expanding the term “sex” to include gender identity, the proposal goes on to state, “under the proposed regulations … a recipient’s education program or activity would include buildings or locations that are part of the school’s operations. … A recipient’s education program or activity would also include all of its academic and other classes, extracurricular activities, [and] athletics programs.” >>> Biden Administration to Force Schools to Adopt Radical Gender Policies. Here’s What You Need to Know. Thus, the department has ensured that the sports issue will be decided in favor of biological men whether or not it engages in additional rule-making. In addition to the above, the new Title IX rule removes commonsense student due process protections in campus sexual assault and harassment proceedings, returning investigative power to the hands of a single, unelected bureaucrat, and gutting the 2020 Title IX rule that established those due process guarantees. It likewise muzzles students and professors by elevating “misgendering” or a failure to use their preferred pronouns as a sufficient basis to launch a Title IX investigation, creating a heckler’s veto of the highest order. The burden is on the Department to provide evidence that Title IX requires modification. Rewinding the clock and pitting males against females once again fails to meet that burden."},

And there isn’t a single, justifiable reason for the department to do this.", "This subpoena has but one intent: to harass and intimidate a conservative organization for daring to engage in the democratic process."], "text": "The Justice Department has hit the Eagle Forum of Alabama with a voluminous subpoena that violates the organization’s First Amendment rights to speak freely, engage in the political process, and talk to their elected representatives. It’s an intimidation tactic, pure and simple, and shows just how partisan the department has become. This out-of-control behavior should scare every citizen and volunteer organization, no matter where they stand on the political or social spectrum. Eagle Forum is a very small non-profit in Alabama. It only has one full-time employee and a second, part-time employee. Virtually all of its work on issues of interest to its members is done by volunteers.  It is the quintessential, uniquely American grassroots membership organization that French historian Alexis de Tocqueville lauded in Democracy in America. As the Eagle Forum’s motion to quash the government subpoena says, one of the issues its members have been concerned over is “gender-altering medical treatment to minors” and the “permanent and adverse effects of such medical procedures on those minors.” Those serious, lifelong effects deeply concern many physicians and parents. Members of the Eagle Forum made their worries known by doing things every American has an absolute right to do: they spoke out, made speeches, organized meetings, talked to other residents and organizations in the state, and contacted their elected state representatives. In other words, they exercised their constitutional rights to engage in “freedom of speech,” to “peaceably assemble,” and “to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” They also exercised their right to associate, recognized by the Supreme Court as implicit under the Fourteenth Amendment. >>> Biden’s DOJ Increases Power and Rewards Political Allies None of these activities should trigger stalking by Justice Department lawyers. So how has this come about? Earlier this year, the Alabama legislature passed the Alabama Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act, which became effective on May 8. It bans puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery to alter the biological sex of a minor. A huge number of left-wing advocacy organizations immediately sued the state, and the U.S. Justice Department intervened in the lawsuit, echoing their claims that the new Alabama law violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Eagle Forum is not a party to the lawsuit. Yet the Justice Department has served what is referred to as a third-party subpoena on the Eagle Forum. This subpoena outrageously demands that the Eagle Forum and its members turn over all: In other words, the Justice Department wants to turn the Eagle Forum inside out, forcing it to turn over its records on everything it does. This would let government lawyers paw through and scrutinize everything, including privileged communications and even personal discussions and communications with other private citizens and nonprofit organizations. And there isn’t a single, justifiable reason for the department to do this. The Eagle Forum is not a party in the lawsuit. It is not a government agency. It is not the legislature. It has no power to vote to enact this (or any) legislation or sign it into law. Keep in mind that the lawsuit is making a constitutional claim. The plaintiffs, including the Justice Department, are arguing that the statute as written violates the U.S. Constitution. So, what do the Eagle Forum’s polling data or social media posts have to do with that constitutional question? What do its internal records, its “policy goals, initiatives, and/or strategies,” or the communications of its members with state legislators have to do with that issue? The answer is: absolutely nothing. None of the documents or information sought by the Justice Department has any relevance to whether the text of a state law violates the Fourteenth Amendment. >>> On Offense Against Radical Gender Ideology This subpoena, issued by Jason R. Cheeks, an attorney in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Northern District of Alabama, has but one intent: to harass and intimidate a conservative organization for daring to engage in the democratic process by working on an issue that inflames the Left. The right to associate freely with other citizens who share your interests was recognized by the Supreme Court in 1959 in NAACP v. Alabama. Ironically enough, in that case, the Alabama state government was harassing the NAACP with similar demands for information due to its work on civil rights issues and legislation. In an affidavit filed with the court in the current case, Rebecca Gerritson, the executive director of the Eagle Forum of Alabama, correctly warns: This is a dangerous action by the Justice Department. It’s something that all Americans who value their constitutional rights should oppose."},

Madrigal-Borloz is the “SOGI czar” at the United Nations. Or, more precisely, he is the U.N.’s so-called independent expert on protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, or SOGI. And the Costa Rican lawyer just concluded an official visit to the United States intended to “assess” the “human rights of LGBT persons” here. In a press conference Tuesday at U.N. headquarters, Madrigal-Borloz shared his initial reactions. He discussed the public health impact of monkeypox, which mostly afflicts gay men. He bemoaned the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade and its “devastating” impact on lesbians and “people with gestational faculties.” And he derided efforts in various American states to limit “gender-affirming care.” Madrigal-Borloz will present an official report of his findings and recommendations to the U.N. Human Rights Council next June. We don’t have to sit in suspense until next year for his recommendations, though. We can hazard a pretty good guess about what his report will say, based upon what he has said in the past. Madrigal-Borloz’s other most recent country visit was to Tunisia last year. His advice to that Arab country included radical proposals that go well beyond preventing violence. There, he voiced concern over “the inability of trans people to access hormonal treatments and gender-affirming operations.” Such interventions, he claimed, are “essential treatments for their survival.” The U.N.’s independent expert also reported that “LGBT sex workers face multiple and aggravated forms of discrimination,” and noted that they must endure “double criminalization for homosexuality, morality, or indecent assault.” But Madrigal-Borloz’s assertions aside, providing chemical and surgical gender transitions for “trans” individuals or removing social stigma and legal penalties for sex workers—the euphemism for prostitutes—is not what most people have in mind when they think about eliminating violence or discrimination. In fact, “gender-affirming care” arguably is violence against children, who lack the maturity to give real consent to drugs and surgeries that leave them infertile, disfigured, and often full of regret. But advocates of these methods, including many within the Biden White House, insist the opposite is true. Despite strong evidence to the contrary, these gender ideology devotees have convinced doctors and parents alike that for children suffering from gender dysphoria—or even just those who might challenge gender stereotypes—gender-affirming care is “lifesaving.” Increasingly, though, countries in Western Europe are backtracking on this approach. The U.K., Finland, and Sweden all are reevaluating how they treat children with gender dysphoria. The tone and topics of Madrigal-Borloz’s earlier reports are also telling. Last year, he submitted two reports to the U.N. General Assembly as well as to the Human Rights Council. His reports were on “the law of inclusion” and “practices of exclusion,” and they solidified the SOGI czar’s reputation as a committed evangelist of radical gender theory. Madrigal-Borloz even recommended using hate speech laws to go after those who oppose awarding new rights on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. This could easily cover religious believers of many traditions. The SOGI czar’s prior report to the Human Rights Council, in 2020, is a scathing attack on what he referred to as “conversion therapy,” which conjured up images of torture. The report uses that label to describe psychologists and therapists, and even clerical counselors, who merely seek to help people cope with unwanted same-sex attraction. It also includes those who seek to help those who suffer from gender dysphoria to reconcile with their own bodies. Madrigal-Borloz advocates banning “conversion therapy” across the board. The effect would be to censor any therapists or religious believers who won’t recite the gender ideology catechism. We should expect the same from Madrigal-Borloz’s visit to the United States. It included meetings with dozens of leftist lawmakers and advocacy groups, including the Human Rights Campaign and the Southern Poverty Law Center. Like Madrigal-Borloz, those who promote policies or rights based on membership in select identity groups rely on pejorative terms such as  “intolerance” and “discrimination” in pursuit of their radical goals. In his remarks this week at the U.N., Madrigal-Borloz proclaimed that “equality is not yet within reach … or within sight for LGBT communities in the United States.” Surely his final report next June will conclude as much. But the reality is not so dire. Americans of all stripes have equal claim to their constitutional and God-given rights. Where injustice or violence occurs, the law is supposed to be blind to the race, sex, and orientation of victims and perpetrators. But the same can’t be said for the U.N.’s SOGI czar.

Biden Administration Wants to Eliminate Women’s Sports.", "author": ["Sarah Parshall Perry", "Abby  Kassal"], "date": "Apr 11, 2022 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/lia-thomas-was-just-the-beginning-biden-administration-wants-eliminate-womens", "takeaways": ["Women are the clear losers—finding themselves right back where they started in their quest for educational, athletic, and professional parity.        ", "With the Education Department’s impending rule change on Title IX, Lia Thomas will be just the beginning of the decimation of women’s opportunities.", "It is time for honesty on the nature of biology as immutable and unchangeable, and on the purpose and essence of Title IX."], "text": "This year marks the 50th anniversary of the passage of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the federal law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in any educational program that is federally funded either directly or indirectly. But in a painful twist of irony, that same rule is now on the chopping block, thanks to an impending change in Title IX’s interpretation and application that, according to published reports, will be coming soon from the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights. In addition to removing commonsense, due process protections for those accused of sexual assault on campus (the right to call witnesses or introduce evidence, for example), this new Title IX rule will unilaterally expand the prohibition against discrimination based on “sex” to include: “sex stereotypes, sex-related characteristics (including intersex traits), pregnancy or related conditions, sexual orientation, and gender identity.” For anyone who’s been half awake since January 2021, it’s clear that this administration’s pet mission is to advance the transgender agenda. Whether by choosing male Cabinet members that identify as women or forcing “gender-affirming” treatments onto doctors with conscience objections, to hear the Biden administration tell it, you might think that trans Americans outnumber “cisgender” Americans, and an epidemic of discrimination and violence is raging against everyone who identifies as trans. Except here’s the problem: they don’t, and there isn’t. This administration has turned the nature of democracy (or, the rule of majority) on its head by bending the 99 to the will of the one. Or, more accurately, the six-tenths of 1% (0.6%). Those kinds of numbers make this administration’s “democratic” policies look more like those of a dictatorship. In this new blue and pink revolution, women are the clear losers—finding themselves right back where they started in their quest for educational, athletic, and professional parity. Considered a feminist triumph at the time, Title IX’s passage represented a historic advancement for women, allowing them both equal educational opportunities and a clear pathway to success later in life. In fact, one study shows that 94% of female executives once played competitive sports. Title IX’s reverberations are felt by the authors to this day. As a young athlete, some of Abby’s formative moments involved cheering on the closest National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I women’s soccer team. Her team of 8-year-old girls loved to watch the women they hoped to one day be. Now, she stands in their shoes, serving as role model for young girls around the country, competing on a NCAA Division I soccer team of her own. As a mother, some of Sarah’s proudest moments have been watching her teenage daughter compete on a nationally ranked volleyball team and dream of one day earning a spot on a college roster. Sarah remembers well the varsity softball years of her own youth, in which Title IX offered her the chance to do what she loved. How quickly the chances of these women for athletic and educational success might have been jeopardized by the inclusion of biological males in their chosen athletic programs. How backward it is to take a women’s movement “win” and subjugate it to a “loss” to the agenda of the radical few. On March 17, University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas, a biological male who competed from 2017-2019 on the University of Pennsylvania men’s swim team as Will Thomas, was crowned the women’s NCAA champion for the 500-yard freestyle event after a year of hormone therapy. Will was an average swimmer—ranked No. 462 in the nation—until he decided he was actually a woman and took a few months of hormone suppressants to prove it. Predictably, no amount of hormone therapy could alter Lia’s massive masculine body frame, denser muscle mass, larger lung size, and greater bone density. Having abandoned his identity as “Will,” “Lia” rocketed to No. 1 in the women’s national swimming rankings. So much for women’s progress. With the Education Department’s impending rule change on Title IX, Lia Thomas will be just the beginning of the decimation of women’s educational and athletic opportunities. If the final Title IX rule is approved, schools across the country can kiss sex equality goodbye. The Department of Education signaled its rule change as far back as June 2021. A Federal Notice of Interpretation of Title IX, published by the Department of Education, indicated that based on the Supreme Court’s ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County in 2020, sex discrimination would be interpreted within Title IX to include discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Applying this rationale to Title IX—erroneously, as Sarah has previously written—removes the law’s intended protections for women and vitiates its very purpose in the first place. Concurrently with the unprecedented 2022 NCAA women’s swimming championships, various states moved to ensure that female athletes in their jurisdictions would not have to face the same violations of Title IX in athletic competitions. Thirteen states have now passed, and their governors have now signed, bills to prevent biological males who identify as females from competing in girls sports. Both the Utah and the Indiana state legislatures passed bills like these, and in both states, the Republican governors vetoed the bills. But the Legislature in Utah rebounded, and overrode the governor’s veto. Just a few days ago, South Carolina’s House of Representatives was the latest to pass a bill protecting girls and young women in sport. It now heads to the state Senate for consideration. Not every female athlete will win a trophy or a scholarship. And the impact that transgender athletes competing in women’s athletics will have on those female athletes who aren’t competing for trophies and scholarships isn’t often discussed. But it’s significant. In fact, most college athletes will never compete for an NCAA title, and many receive little to no scholarship money during their athletic careers. A release from the NCAA in August 2020 noted that only 57% of all student athletes receive athletic scholarships—and most of these student athletes receive partial scholarships, despite the common misconception that college athletes generally receive full-ride scholarships. When 43% of NCAA student athletes don’t even receive partial athletic scholarships, the issue’s scope becomes clearer. These students aren’t just losing a chance to get money for school, they’re losing a chance to get on the playing field in the first place. Athletics fosters natural competition. According to a 2020 NCAA research study, only about 0.06% of male high school athletes and 0.06% of female high school athletes progress to compete in NCAA sports at any level (Division I, II, or III). The percentage shrinks even more when considering athletes competing in each division. On each team at each school in all three NCAA divisions, the most talented competitors win scholarships. But a certain number of athletes on every team choose to play despite a lack of financial aid. These athletes can and do contribute just as much to their teams as their teammates who receive scholarships. But women who are members of college athletics teams, but who are on the lower end of the talent range, will be the first victims of this new, lawless interpretation of Title IX. It is time for honesty on the nature of biology as immutable and unchangeable, and on the purpose and essence of Title IX—a federal law once advanced by liberals and feminists as ultimately protective of the rights of women and girls (but on which many have turned their backs). When the Department of Education, the NCAA, and governors advocate for the inclusion of biological males in women’s athletics, they are undoing the 50 years of progress made under Title IX. Now, more than ever, female athletes are fighting for their right to fairly compete. Along with filling the shoes of the athletes who paved the way, we must resist such a lawless interpretation of longstanding law to ensure that the next generation of female athletes gets the same opportunities we had—and no less. A coalition of 26 signatories has signaled its concerns with the impending rule change in a letter released Monday, and on Tuesday, 15 attorneys general (led by the Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen) sent a letter to the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Education, demanding the rule-making process on Title IX be stopped and threatening legal action. The department’s announcement of the proposed Title IX rule is expected sometime this month. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

"], "text": "It seems Biden’s State Department has decided it must do even more to shame countries into normalizing same-sex relations. It announced a new grant to “promote greater social acceptance of LGBTQI+ persons” in a small African country using U.S. tax dollars. The grant is advertised as “Beyond Decriminalization: Expanding LGBTQI+ Rights in Botswana,” and identifies “influential religious groups” as targets to lobby in its campaign. This tactic is likely to harm U.S. relations with Botswana. The Batswana may not be so keen on U.S. pressure to change their religious beliefs and social mores. Like many African countries, Botswana is home to a religious and socially conservative people. It is among Africa’s oldest democracies and considered one of the least corrupt countries on the continent. Nearly 80 percent of the citizens of Botswana are Christians. And according to the U.S. State Department’s Report on International Religious Freedom, the country boasts “a high degree of religious tolerance and robust interfaith relations.” Presumably, the U.S. government has decided that it is these Christians whose attitudes and beliefs must change. But while in South Africa last week Secretary of State Antony Blinken claimed the opposite. “The United States will not dictate Africa’s choices,” he pledged. “Neither should anyone else. The right to make these choices belongs to Africans, and Africans alone.” Contrast that with the Biden administration’s aggressive agendas in Botswana and other developing countries. Under the mantle of sexual and reproductive health the Biden team is pushing abortion across the globe. In the name of “equity and equality” it promotes radical gender ideology and critical race theory. In their climate crusade, it promotes contraception and population control. And with its pursuit of “LGBTQI+ rights,” American foreign policy is undermining religious freedom. This adds up to nothing short of ideological colonialism. In what may be a related effort, the State Department is also seeking to fund atheism abroad, ironically, under the framework of religious freedom. Another grant, also targeting Africa as well as south and central Asia, will use U.S. federal funds for “creating or strengthening networks of advocates for … atheist, humanist, non-practicing and non-affiliated individuals.” But promoting atheism with U.S. tax dollars is just as problematic as promoting social acceptance of “LGBTQI+ rights.” U.S. foreign policy should avoid cultural imperialism. It’s not the job of our State Department to meddle in the domestic laws of sovereign countries—provided they protect human rights. This principle of sovereignty has long governed international relations. Lest the Biden White House forget, there is no human right to engage in sexual relations outside of marriage. No human rights treaty—negotiated and ratified by sovereign nations—includes such “rights.” As such, many countries regulate or prohibit behavior such as adultery, fornication, prostitution, and pedophilia. A country’s laws on these matters are bound to reflect its cultural and religious traditions. Such public morality laws do not violate human rights or democracy. They simply violate the orthodoxy of the globalist and secular left. Notably, Botswana recently liberalized its laws on same-sex relations, likely reflecting changing sentiment within their population. That has not helped it escape the notice of the gender ideologues in the current U.S. administration. The U.S. grant for promoting LGBTQI+ issues in Botswana is not unique. Last year the State Department issued a notice of funding for up to $1 million for Global Equality Fund LGBTQI+ Programs in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. The Global Equality Fund (GEF) is a partnership between companies, foundations, and governments to support LGBTQI+ initiatives. Besides addressing violence or abuse, the GEF seeks to eliminate “criminalization, discrimination, and stigma” related to sexual orientation or gender identity. Opposing violence and discrimination is not the same as promoting social acceptance and affirmation. The U.S. must promote fundamental human rights, grounded in human dignity, for every man, woman, and child. That is a proper role for our State Department. Targeting religious believers with hostile ideological agendas is not. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

Earlier that year, reports broke of a British surgeon who had amputated the healthy limbs of two patients. What author Carl Elliott found underneath these strange events was even more puzzling. A once rare condition—psychological distress over healthy limbs—was now plaguing thousands. How did this happen? In his interviews with amputee-wannabes, Elliott discovered a common factor fueling what is now called Body Integrity Identity Disorder (BIID): the internet. For those with access, the internet provided a flood of information and social connections. Its disembodied, anonymous environment may have made the problem worse. The result? An ecological niche in which BIID could bloom. That was 2000, when internet use was far less addictive and ubiquitous than it is today. Since then, “new media”—the internet, smartphones, and social media—have spread almost perennial strains of body dysmorphia. By the mid-2010s, Tumblr’s image-saturated blogs were fueling pro-anorexia, or “pro-ana,” blogs. Today, TikTok is filling teens’ feeds with eating disorder content, and Instagram is causing body image issues for 1 in 3 teen girls. >>> Does “Gender-Affirming Care” For Trans Kids Actually Prevent Suicide? Here’s What The Data Say There has been public outcry against these tech-fueled crazes in outlets like, well, the Atlantic. But the latest contagion has been ignored outside conservative media: rapid onset gender dysphoria. Worse, much of the left has celebrated the phenomenon in the name of “inclusivity,” “equality,” and—this month—“Pride.” Like the amputee-wannabes of 2000 or anorexic teens of the 2010s, new media are fueling yet another form of teenage self-harm. Take Keira Bell, the young woman who won a United Kingdom High Court case against the gender clinic that fast-tracked her transition. Before the counselor’s office, clinic, or classroom, she was exposed to gender ideology on the internet. Or consider Grace Lidinsky-Smith, who was featured on the 60 Minutes transgender report. Grace has traced her “gender journey” back to social media: “It all started when I got on Tumblr as a 13-year-old.” For Grace’s teenage self, virtual “friends” helped diagnose her anxiety and depression as symptoms of being born in the wrong body. Helena Kirschner, a popular American detransitioner, has also shared how social media incubated her desire to transition. Like Grace, Helena’s transgender fantasy began on Tumblr, which she used “as an all-day alternate reality escape from the real world.” The evidence of internet contagion extends beyond the anecdotal. Recent surveys find that most teens who transition are exposed, encouraged, and supported online. In one survey, 65 percent of those who transitioned cited online groups, forums, and/or social media as the biggest sources of help. Another survey found that YouTube, blogs, Tumblr, and online forums were the top sources that persuaded detransitioners to transition in the first place. Much of this is a real-time experiment with tens of thousands of teenagers. But the harms of transitioning are already well documented. Transitioning, like cutting off a limb or starving oneself, has irreversible effects. It also fails to address the underlying problems driving gender dysphoria. Puberty blockers lead to bone-density problems. Cross-sex hormones sterilize. Removed breasts or ovaries can’t be replaced. What’s more, the longest-term study on the subject finds that those who surgically transition are 19 times more likely to commit suicide than their peers. In contrast, the 5th edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders cites that, of youth struggling with gender dysphoria, 88 to 98 percent will reconcile with their biological sex if allowed to go through puberty. Despite these harms and new media’s role in spreading contagion, platforms proudly propagate “pro-trans” content. A quick search for “top surgery” on TikTok—the top social media platform used by today’s teens—loads not one, not two, but an endless scroll of videos promoting happy faces atop mutilated chests. One such video has over 29.1 million views, some 618,600 likes, and almost 10,000 comments. Other top results have hundreds of thousands or even millions of views. The same content saturates Instagram and Twitter feeds. >>> Social Media Is Hurting Kids, but a Fix May Be on Horizon Not so with pro-anorexia blogs. As early as 2001, Yahoo was deplatforming blogs that fueled eating disorders. When the problem surfaced on its servers around 2012, Tumblr did the same. Today, all major social media platforms prohibit such content. They have disabled search results for eating disorder hashtags. Some, like Pinterest, Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, have even gone so far as to ban or restrict weight loss ads. Today, with the majority of teens’ day-to-day lives taking place online, greater protections are needed to stop the promotion of self-harm online. As of 2021, 71 percent of American youth own smartphones by age 12, and 84 percent of teens 13 to 18 use social media. The average American teen spends almost 9 hours a day on screens. Until social media platforms provide more robust parental controls and adopt policies restricting or banning “pro-trans” content, there’s virtually nothing keeping kids from falling down algorithmic rabbit holes that encourage the dangerous practice of transitioning. If parents and policymakers want to protect kids from the self-harm of transitioning, then they need to turn up the heat on tech companies. As long as these companies promote and provide platforms for gender transition, the bodies and futures of teenagers will be at risk."},

", "Granting ambassadors the leeway to fly flags according to their individual ideological bent or local sentiments does not present a united policy front abroad."], "text": "For the second year in a row, the U.S. embassy to the Vatican has flown the “Pride” flag. To what purpose? We know the position of the Catholic church on matters of homosexuality, and surely they know the state of current American law and society. (If not, we have a fully staffed embassy there to explain it to the Vatican’s entire population of around 800.) Who in that tiny city is supposed to be inspired by that flag, and to what end? The flagpole outside a U.S. embassy or facility overseas should fly only one flag: the Stars and Stripes, supported by a base or unit pennant where appropriate. Flying a flag symbolizing domestic political positions is undiplomatic virtue-signaling at best, and counter-productive provocation at worst. Last year, in anticipation of Pride month, Secretary of State Antony Blinken authorized U.S. ambassadors to fly the Pride flag, but left it to their discretion, based on local conditions. Discretion is the coin of diplomacy. We do not fly a feminist flag (there is one) outside of our embassies in the Middle East, nor the Taiwanese or Tibetan flags outside Embassy in Beijing, because doing so would inform no one, accomplish nothing, and needlessly irritate already difficult relationships. Flags are to diplomacy what skywriting is to marriage proposals: unsubtle and hard to walk back. >>> Why America Needs Better Men Last year, several U.S. embassies and consulates flew Black Lives Matter flags to recognize George Floyd or the Juneteenth holiday. A State Department memo at the time said: “The Department … encourage[s] posts to focus on the need to eliminate systemic racism and its continued impact.” According to the left, America is infused with “systemic racism,” an invisible web of laws, practices, and values that feed white supremacy and repress people of color. Even if one were to accept this contentious theory, is it applicable to our foreign relations with Benin, or Bangladesh, whose social tensions have completely different roots in tribe or caste? We undermine American credibility when we seek to export, symbolically, all but the most essential and unchanging of our values. While it is obvious U.S. policy that black lives matter, flying a flag closely associated with the BLM organization founded by Patrisse Cullors and Alicia Garza implies official U.S. support for a domestic group that has done little tangible good, allegedly misspent millions of donor dollars, and espoused specific policies—such as “defund the police” and “ban former President Trump from future political office”—that are not supported by the current administration, let alone most Americans. The organization also bears hostility to the state of Israel. BLM’s aggressive pro-Palestinian stance is just one, extreme position held by one segment of the progressive movement, and it certainly does not reflect official U.S. foreign policy. So, about that Pride flag… President Biden’s very first Executive Order “directed all federal agencies to implement fully all federal laws that prevent discrimination on the basis of sex, to include … gender identity.” It also speaks of “gender-affirming medical care.” These concepts are far from firmly agreed or entrenched in U.S. law or culture. Early medical intervention for teenagers has cemented into administration policy, although it puts children on a path to sterilization and life-long medical complications. However, there has been serious expert re-thinking of the idea that children presenting with body dysphoria, or who identify with a gender that does not match their biological sex, should be “affirmed” through prescription of puberty blocking drugs, cross-sex hormones, and surgery. In light of evidence that most children with body dysphoria grow out of it after puberty, and seeing the permanent harm caused by misguided early transitions, several governments in Europe have reversed earlier policies requiring “affirmative” treatment of children and adolescents. Today’s Pride parade is not the celebration of tolerance it once was. The mayor of San Francisco, of all places, refused to march in this year’s parade after organizers banned all police officers—including “LGBTQ+ officers [who] march voluntarily and without compensation”—from marching in uniform because “the presence of the police in the parade is difficult for them, given their history with the police department.” Firefighters boycotted in solidarity, and thus what could have been a celebration of progress and tolerance turned into a circular firing squad with ever-decreasing circles of virtue. >>> State of the Union: An Annual Review of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Legislation Today’s Pride flag is not the simple rainbow of the 1970s, signifying pride and acceptance of same-sex attraction. The updated version is a profusion of stripes, chevrons, and circles, with at least 12 colors indicating different points of view, including people who “identify outside the gender binary.” Is this ever-changing tableau of social discussion something we should run up the flagpole at our missions overseas next to Old Glory, whose meaning has been clear for generations and is (in theory) shared by all Americans? American society is still wrestling with issues of race, gender, and politics; we are in no position to preach to others. What happened to the idea, as Sen. Arthur Vandenburg put it in 1947, that “we must stop partisan politics at the water’s edge”? Do ambassadors in favor of gun rights get to fly the NRA flag? How about the D.C. flag supporting statehood for the District of Columbia? What about flags symbolizing positions on abortion, or immigration? Granting ambassadors the leeway to fly flags according to their individual ideological bent or local sentiments does not present a united policy front abroad. Rather, it will send confused and uncoordinated messages to our allies as well as our enemies. The Biden administration and Secretary of State Blinken should direct that, henceforth, only the Stars and Stripes fly over our foreign missions."},
{"title": "Biden Administration Holds School Lunches Hostage to Radical Transgender Agenda", "author": ["Sarah Parshall Perry"], "date": "Jun 13, 2022 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/biden-administration-holds-school-lunches-hostage-radical-transgender-agenda", "takeaways": ["Such a change will, among other things, open up every single-sex restroom, locker room, housing accommodation, sports team, or admission program to the opposite sex.", "Now, a school’s failure to adhere to “gender identity” anti-discrimination policies will put their federal nutrition assistance funding at risk.", "The Biden administration’s weaponization of federal law appears to be far from over."], "text": "There’s been plenty of sturm und drang over the upcoming Title IX rule change from the Department of Education—one that will expand the prohibition against “sex” discrimination under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to “gender identity” discrimination. And the sturm und drang is well warranted. Such a change—anticipated for release this month—will, among other things, open up every single-sex restroom, locker room, housing accommodation, sports team, or admission program to the opposite sex, if those individuals simply claim to be female. A June release of the new rule poetically coincides with Title IX’s 50th anniversary and LGBTQ Pride Month. Because of the significance of the new rule, it might have been easy to miss the Biden administration’s most diabolical move yet in its battle for mass transgender acceptance. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has recently announced that it, too, will interpret the prohibition on discrimination based on “sex” found in Title IX to include “sexual orientation and gender identity.” Except it goes further: It will also expand the “sex” discrimination definition found in the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 amended by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly the food stamp program) in precisely the same way. Why does that matter? Because it holds food for needy children hostage to the transgender agenda. In a memorandum from May, the USDA directed all state agencies and Food and Nutrition Act program operators to “expeditiously review their program discrimination complaint procedures and make any changes necessary to ensure complaints alleging discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation are processed and evaluated as complaints of discrimination on the basis of sex.” As with all its other expansions of “sex” discrimination in federal law, the administration has proffered the U.S. Supreme Court’s Bostock v. Clayton County opinion extending workplace discrimination protections under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to gay and transgender employees, as justification for its new interpretation of “sex” discrimination in the Food and Nutrition Act and school lunch program. This doesn’t come as much of a surprise for anyone who remembers that on Day One his presidency, Joe Biden issued an executive order on sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination making clear that every federal agency was going to toe the line on a new sexual orthodoxy, and cited Bostock as support. But as I’ve written and publicly testified, the White House has gone far afield of the court’s ruling, expanding it beyond what the justices stated clearly in the opinion was limited to Title VII only. Even major media outlets, such as USA Today’s “Fact Check,” were forced to admit that Biden’s executive order called for a “broader application of last year’s Supreme Court Bostock v. Clayton County ruling.” The Food and Nutrition Act and SNAP programs—administered by the USDA—provide nutrition assistance to eligible, low-income individuals and households via monthly benefits on an electronic payment card—similar to a debit card—which can be used at stores to purchase food. The Food and Nutrition Act also establishes the National School Lunch Program, which is administered by state agencies that receive federal funding through the USDA and then enter into agreements with individual schools to provide that funding. The school lunch program services over 21 million needy schoolchildren every day—children who rely on it in order to have breakfast, lunch, or both. Approximately 100,000 public and private schools, and even some residential child care facilities, receive federal funding to provide subsidized free or reduced-price meals for qualifying children. But now, a school’s failure to adhere to “gender identity” anti-discrimination policies and open restrooms, locker rooms, or sports teams to those professing to be the opposite sex will put their federal nutrition assistance funding at risk. That means that needy kids—no matter their sexual orientation or gender identity—might have to go without meals at school. The USDA has even made clear that “there will not be a grace period for accepting and processing discrimination complaints based on sexual orientation and gender identity in [Food and Nutrition Service] programs.” It has allowed participating schools extra time to order and display required lunchroom posters and update their nondiscrimination policies—as long as they can demonstrate efforts taken to comply with the guidance provided before the USDA issues a finding of “noncompliance.” With the ramping up of gender identitarianism in public education and the consistent push to make disciples of the church of transgender, is it any wonder that, for example, middle school students are now being named in Title IX complaints for not using a fellow student’s “preferred pronouns”? Or that seven states now require the teaching of LGBTQ-specific topics in school? Or that a teacher in Massachusetts is introducing kindergarteners to concepts like transgenderism and gender queer—but not fully defining them because that is apparently just “too much” for kindergartners? (Please. Spare us your sanctimonious reluctance.) While the release of the Title IX rule is anticipated later this month, USDA has stated that additional guidance on timelines and implementation is forthcoming. The Biden administration’s weaponization of federal law—whether Title IX, the Food and Nutrition Act, or other things—to strong-arm American schools, students, and families into compliance with its gender-fluid policies appears to be far from over.

See here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here. This flood was expected after President Biden appointed a leftist, Xavier Becerra, as HHS Secretary and transgender-activist par excellence, Dr. Rachel (formerly Richard) Levine, as Assistant Secretary of Health. But a funny thing happened on the way to transforming HHS into the Department of Health and Gender Services. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an HHS sub-agency, just abandoned its plans to force millions of people to pay for other people’s transgender treatments by declaring them “essential health benefits” under proposed Obamacare insurance regulations. You may be wondering how this surprising about face came to pass. It was because a dedicated coalition of advocates discovered this radical proposal to transform health care and used nothing but their knowledge and voices to block it. Here’s how we did it. >>> LISTEN: Exposing the Left’s Hypocrisy on Women’s Health Literally one of the first things Biden did after entering office was sign an Executive Order giving every federal agency 100 days to submit a plan to “promulgate new agency actions” to further the LGBT agenda, including with respect to “access to healthcare.” In keeping with this promise, last October, HHS bragged that it had launched a pilot program requiring transgender insurance coverage in Colorado that included “eye and lid modifications, face tightening, facial bone remodeling for facial feminization, breast/chest construction and reductions, and laser hair removal.” So, if you are in Colorado, there is a good chance your insurance premiums are helping to pay for breast implants and chin tucks for biological men. As I told the Washington Post at the time that, “This is a liberal administration and governor colluding to mandate coverage for a lifetime of cross-sex hormones and removal of healthy organs, including for minors. . . . Their end game is clear, to push these dangerous experimental treatments on kids and unwilling families as a national insurance mandate.” I hate to say I told you so, but . . . allow me to direct you to January 5 of this year, when CMS posted a 408 page proposed regulation innocuously titled “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2023.” Normally, these sorts of regulations contain lots (and lots) of boring technical insurance changes that only an ERISA lawyer could love. But not with this administration. It took this anodyne regulation as a golden opportunity to impose the “essential health benefits” transgender-insurance mandate nationwide. Quietly unveiling such a major change in such an unlikely place—during the holiday season no less—is bad enough, but giving the public a mere 22 days (instead of the typical 60) to submit comments on the regulation reeks of cynicism and disrespect. The Biden people clearly hoped the American public wouldn’t notice, and most people didn’t. But not everyone. Because I had successfully worked to restore the scientific and biological understanding of sex at HHS while a senior official there during the Trump administration, I had a personal interest in this issue and wasn’t about to let this one slip by without a fight. So, after rallying like-minded folks and several long nights of drafting, I, along with my EPPC colleagues Rachel Morrison, Ryan Anderson, and Mary Hasson, submitted formal comments to the agency opposing the rule, as did my colleagues at the Heritage Foundation, five Senate and 20 House Republicans, the Christian Employers Alliance, the Christian Medical & Dental Associations, the Family Policy Alliance, the Family Research Council, the Southern Baptist Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission, as well as the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Christian Legal Society, National Association of Evangelicals, National Association of Catholic Nurses, U.S.A., The National Catholic Bioethics Center, and Thomas More Society (jointly). We objected to the rule enshrining bad medicine into law, especially concerning children. We objected to the rule’s coercion. We objected to its exorbitant costs. We objected to the breaks with proper procedure. We also substantiated all the above with evidence. >>> State of the Union: An Annual Review of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Legislation In the face of this coordinated response, and to my genuine surprise, yesterday, HHS caved. It completely abandoned the transgender-insurance portions of the proposed rule, saying that they would deal with the issue in a future rulemaking under antidiscrimination provisions known as Section 1557 of Obamacare. This allowed HHS to finalize the bulk of the technical, boring parts of the rule without having to respond to our comments. Unbeknownst to most citizens, federal agencies are required by law to read, evaluate, and respond to substantive comments submitted on regulations.gov before the deadline for major rules. Here, HHS choose to raise the white flag, at least for now, in order to avoid having to deal with the many weighty objections we raised, even though the proposed rule was explicitly justified as furthering a presidential priority. Our comments caused internal debate and dissension within the Biden administration about priorities and resources resulting in the scrapping of the original plans. This tremendous victory was achieved solely because a group of us exercised our rights to petition the government for a redress of grievances. See Amend. I, U.S. Const. Will this radical administration try to impose a transgender mandate again in the future? Absolutely. But now, they will have to start the process all over again, and when that time comes we will be ready, and next time, we’re bringing friends."},

Opinion polling from Pew in 2020 shows that most women under 30 (68 percent) identify as feminists. Feminism tugs at our aspirations and summons our loyalties. We want to be strong, confident, and self-reliant, like the pictured feminist. Our mothers and grandmothers have told us dismaying stories of what the workplace was like before the cultural shifts of The Feminine Mystique. Yet nearly 40 percent of women also believe that feminism is polarizing. They are right: Modern feminism is a branch of identity politics. By functioning as an interest group that solely represents women, it has been (at best) deaf to other injustices, including a crisis in our own homes: the boy crisis. The Boy Crisis, written by Warren Farrell and John Gray, tells the staggering story of how our young men are being left behind. By the eighth grade, 41 percent of girls are at least proficient in writing, compared with just 20 percent of boys. Men now earn 39 percent of college degrees while the median annual earnings of a man with a high-school diploma have dropped 26 percent in the past 40 years. >>> The White House Plan to Make Gender Ideology a Central Theme of the American Experiment The consequences are dire. Fifteen- to 19-year-old boys commit suicide at four times the rate of girls. Ninety-three percent of those in prison are men, and, according to the authors, “more black boys between ten and twenty are killed by homicide than by the next nine leading causes of death combined.” As civil-rights activist and community-development leader Robert Woodson says, “If you devalue your life, you’ll either take your own, or you’ll take someone else’s.” Our young men, he adds, are “dying in acts of self-hatred.” The absence of fathers—this includes the fact that they do not get equal time with their children—is the primary driver of the boy crisis. Both mothers and fathers are indispensable and contribute uniquely to raising children. With 40 percent of children born out of wedlock and custody laws favoring mothers, more children are missing Dad’s, rather than Mom’s, influence. Just some of the effects of dad deprivation include higher rates of suicide, drug use, violence, hypertension, poverty, lack of empathy, and ADHD. The sexual revolution is partially responsible for this crisis. Around 1972–73, the National Organization for Women started pushing for custody laws that favored mothers. Farrell, who served on the New York City board of NOW, approached the organization’s leaders at the time. “I argued that children were the priority, not women or men, and that even the nascent evidence we had at the time suggested that children did better with both parents,” he recalls in The Boy Crisis. “Many board members were sympathetic, but they felt that NOW’s primary mission was to support women and that if NOW undermined its political base it would undermine its ability to support women. . . . Mothers’ rights trumped equal rights.” Proponents of the sexual revolution treated women as an isolated interest group, rather than citizens with rights and duties. Interest groups focus on narrow issues and advocate on behalf of their constituencies. For example, teachers’ unions represent teachers, sometimes at the expense of students. And the National Organization for Women represents women, sometimes to the detriment of men and families. Such feminists were self-interested. Or seemingly self-interested. It does not benefit women to have and raise children on their own or select a husband from among men struggling with addiction, depression, and a crisis of purpose, as our boys in crisis are likely to become. Women are not atomized individuals but citizens situated within communities affected by this crisis and by what happens to families. As Mary Harrington, a contributing editor at UnHerd, argues in “The Sexual Revolution Killed Feminism”: “Defending women’s interests is properly, and rightly, a defense of the family. Which is to say of all humans including men—understood as relational beings.” Women have an obligation in this crisis—a moral obligation—as mothers, wives, and sisters. This civic-centered understanding harkens back to an earlier conception of feminism. First-wave feminists desired full participation as citizens, and they acted as citizens, affirming the importance of individual rights as well as the family. They won on equality before the law, the right to vote, and property rights. But they were also abolitionists; they opposed abortion; and, out of concern for the human character and the devastating effects of alcohol abuse on the family, they led the temperance movement >>> Biden’s Latest Proposal Would Force Insurers to Pay for Gender “Transition” For feminism to earn women’s allegiance today, it would need to replicate this approach: one that is holistic and confronts the injustices of our time. Whatever affects the family also has an impact on women, and certain cultural trends have severely damaged the boys in our families. According to an Ethics and Public Policy Center report on porn, porn addiction is rampant and leads to a “greater tolerance of sexual violence toward women,” and it has been linked to sexual aggression. Religion, which provides guidelines for behavior and a moral code, is on the decline, many polls show. Fathers are absent, and healthy masculinity is attacked. But it is good men who get the rest in line. Addressing the boy crisis in the spirit of first-wave feminism requires the partnership of men and women rather than the advocacy of an interest group rooted in identity politics. Custody laws should not presumptively favor Mom. Fathers need to take responsibility, and women need to demand it of them. American women are strong, smart, and ambitious—capable of directing the American conscience. In thinking of what we can do to bring about a more just society, we should aim high and take on a task worthy of our energies. If feminism is, as Harrington writes at UnHerd, “a story of how men and women renegotiated life in common,” the main character of our next chapter should be our boys."},

Radical activists and policymakers are using these tactics to restrict parents’ involvement in their children’s health care and education. Now some state lawmakers are responding with another “r”—reinforcing parental rights. First, the radicals: In Vermont, lawmakers introduced a proposal that would allow young children to receive puberty-delaying hormones or other “treatments” without the consent of a parent or guardian. Minor children could take the drastic step of trying to assume a different “gender” without their parent’s input. Policies based on what are called “critical gender studies” remove parents from essential health care decisions concerning their children—including decisions made in a school setting. Similar provisions are already in place in New Jersey, California and elsewhere. So-called gender warriors are also renaming ideas to distort facts. Students often struggle with depression and confusing sexual emotions simultaneously. Critical gender theorists say students need “gender-affirming” treatment and, with little research to support these interventions (and without parental consent), encourage students to take hormones that can lead to infertility and encourage irreversible surgeries that can damage sexual organs. >>> A Critical Look at Critical Race Theory in America’s Classrooms Critical race theory is a relative of critical gender theory. Adherents of both theories use the same renaming tactic to advance their agendas. “Antiracist,” for example, does not mean you oppose racism. It means you believe that racial discrimination is necessary today to counter discrimination by prior generations. Educators teaching such concepts have tried to hide these lessons from parents, too. Special interest groups and federal lawmakers are trying to restrain parents from being involved in school activities. The National School Board Association did exactly this in collusion with federal officials last fall in an attempt to restrict parents’ participation in school board meetings. Yet earlier this year, Florida lawmakers adopted a “parent bill of rights” to affirm a family’s importance in a child’s life. Radicals promptly labeled this bill the “Don’t Say Gay” bill despite commonsense provisions stating that K-12 teaching content should be age-appropriate. Ambiguous lessons on “gender identity” should not be taught to children in kindergarten to third grade. Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita recently released a guidebook outlining key provisions that policymakers should include in a parent bill of rights. It includes the right to see what their children are learning, including reading lists and course syllabi. It establishes parents as the primary decision-makers for their child’s medical treatments. It also says, correctly, that critical race theory’s “teachings are widespread” and the theory’s “principles are not rooted in American history or known historical fact.” Kansas lawmakers responded to critical gender studies and critical race theory with a proposal that strengthens a parent’s right to make medical decisions concerning their school-aged children. The proposal also rejects school activities based on critical race theory that result in racial discrimination. State lawmakers proposed that no teacher or student shall be compelled to “believe, profess or adhere to any idea that violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964.” The Civil Rights Act’s colorblind provisions are crucial. Critical race theorists falsely teach that white lawmakers only allowed this seminal piece of American law to pass to preserve white power—a strange argument considering the ethnicities of those who have served and serve today in positions of authority. >>> New Jersey Schools Want To Talk to Kids About Sex—And Keep It a Secret Surveys show parents want their children taught that slavery and Jim Crow laws were tragedies but that these racist institutions do not represent who we are as a country. No one should have to profess that America is systemically racist. As a general rule, doctors do not prescribe medicine to a young child because the child demands treatment based on their feelings—why should the hard-to-describe emotions surrounding “gender” be any different? Critical race and gender theory corrupt these ideas while activists try to dissolve parents’ authority over their child’s schooling. Parents are the most important adults in a child’s life. Instead of marginalizing them, state officials should be empowering, encouraging and engaging them."},

In today’s Army, though that notion is officially passé. At a recent Senate hearing, we learned that Army physical fitness has been sacrificed on the altar of gender equity, a move that former infantryman Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., noted, will “get soldiers killed.” Army Secretary Christine Wormuth admitted to Cotton that the service had abandoned efforts to ensure that soldiers’ fitness in physically demanding Army career fields—such as artillery—was being continuously assessed to ensure they met the standards. A subsequent exchange revealed that the Army’s minimum fitness standards have been dramatically compromised. This wasn’t what we were sold when President Barack Obama’s Secretary of Defense, Ashton Carter, opened all combat positions to women seven years ago. He directed that “leaders assign tasks and career fields throughout the force based on ability, not gender.” Obviously, not all Army career fields require the same levels of physical fitness. A cyber sergeant doesn’t need to run a seven-minute mile. But an artillery crewmember must be able to lift and carry a 90-pound artillery shell. Most Americans can’t meet that standard. So, to ensure readiness of the force, the Army needed a way to make these continuing objective assessments to meet Carter’s guidance that soldiers have abilities necessary for their career fields. >>> New Administration Policy Further Undermines Trust in Military Commanders Enter the Army’s new Combat Fitness Test or ACFT. Designed over 10 years, it consists of six events, all chosen as a proxy for the types of strength soldiers need on the modern battlefield. The standards were gender-neutral to objectively assess who could serve in which Army positions. The Army spent years studying the standards necessary to succeed in its 190 different career fields. Unlike previous fitness tests, the ACFT had no categories for male and female. Color-coded scoring bands were established for each of the six ACFT events. For artillery crewmembers, the level of performance required were the highest, coded “black.” To achieve the “black” standard for a two-mile run time, for example, a soldier needed to finish in 18 minutes and deadlift 200 pounds. Similarly high scores were required in the other four events. It was a tough but science-based system that ensured soldiers who held these physically demanding positions were able to continue to contribute effectively and succeed. It was scheduled for implementation for October 2021. Then Congress and advocacy groups intervened. Alarmed that women were scoring lower than men were on trial tests of the ACFT, Congress passed a law delaying the test and requiring an independent assessment. Months later, Rand, who performed the study, returned with shocking news: Males and females score differently on fitness tests. Thus, greater numbers of women than men would not be eligible to serve and remain in the Army’s most physically demanding career fields. Under heavy pressure, the Army surrendered. They threw out the gender-neutral ACFT, effectively abandoning any effort to link continued physical fitness to career fields and simultaneously watering down the baseline fitness standards. Asked “why” by Sen. Cotton, Secretary Wormuth replied: “We wanted to make sure that we didn’t unfairly have standards for a particular subgroup that people, you know, couldn’t perform. We didn’t want to disadvantage any subgroups.” So now the entire Army is disadvantaged, its readiness degraded in the name of “fairness.” The desire to put “equitable” outcomes first is reducing elite combat units to the lowest common denominator. It is a recipe for defeat. Worse, not only did the Army remove any link between continuing physical fitness and career fields, it also significantly lowered the minimum scores necessary to pass. The new ACFT passing standard for a female age 17-21 for the two-mile run is over four minutes slower than the old standards. A female soldier can take a leisurely 23 minutes, a male 22 minutes, and still pass. The number of required pushups went down by nine, to a total of 10. Cotton, unable to hide his disgust during the hearing, called the lowered standards “absolutely pathetic.” This is not to say no women can meet the physical standards to serve in combat units. More than 100 women have graduated from the Army’s grueling Ranger School, its most physically demanding course. >>> Military Recruiting Faces Its Biggest Challenge in Years One of the first graduates, Cpt. Kristen Griest, recently expressed strong views on the subject: “While the equity question must be addressed, the answer is not to implement gender-based scoring or reduce the minimum standards for combat arms. Doing so would have both immediate and insidious impacts on combat effectiveness, as well as on women’s credibility and potential.” Some may think this doesn’t matter—that modern combat is all about “pushing buttons.” Think again. In Ukraine today, soldiers are lugging 90-pound shells and 50-pound Javelins all across the country to defeat Vladimir Putin’s brutal invaders. Cotton concluded his questioning by warning, “I’m not going to let it stand.” For the sake of America’s Army, let’s hope he doesn’t."},

Talking to her about the biological differences between a boy and a girl? And the damage caused by hormone therapies that only partially make someone resemble a member of the opposite sex and the irreversible surgeries that can often follow That’s against school rules. This fall, New Jersey’s department of education will be teaching young children in 2nd grade to ponder their \"gender identity.\" True, young people can sometimes feel confused about their sexuality. But radical gender activists want children to believe that these emotions matter more than their biological sex and that their gender does not depend on biology. >>> We Can Save Education. Here’s How. Activists also want children and educators to know that parents’ opinions on this subject do not matter. New Jersey’s education agency has created lesson plans that separate the ideas of gender, which radicals claim is a choice, from biology, what we are born with. Yet as I explain in my book, Splintered: Critical Race Theory and the Progressive War on Truth, critical gender theory is a close relative of critical race theory. Both theories put personal feelings over facts. Feelings can change over time, though, especially among school-aged children. Instruction about \"gender identity\" and unquestioning affirmations of subjective impressions of gender have drastic consequences. Hormone therapies and gender-related surgical procedures are life-altering decisions. Such treatments can lead to sterilization, changes to your physical appearance, mood swings, and alter your sexual organs. Youth who report feeling confused about their sexuality also frequently report anxiety and depression. Pre-teens and teenagers are already riding an emotional roller coaster thanks to puberty. So \"treating\" a child with cross-sex hormones—estrogen for boys and testosterone for girls—is a serious matter. Such treatments are rash, at best. Research finds that when minors experience confusion about their sexuality, these feelings resolve on their own in 88-98 percent of cases. Parents and family members are the most important people in a child’s life. They should be the first ones to whom teachers and school officials turn when educators spot depression in a child or that a minor is confused about their sexuality. In New Jersey, though, as well as many other places around the country, school leaders are intentionally keeping information about a child’s chosen gender identity away from parents. A New Jersey Department of Education statement on transgender students says, \"A school district shall accept a student’s asserted gender identity; parental consent is not required.\" So if school officials encourage a minor child to assume a different gender identity and counsel them to begin medical treatments that delay physical development, they are sending a child down a dangerous path. Again, so-called gender-affirming treatments lead to changes in everything from body hair to bone density to changes in their sexual organs. Imagine being a parent who discovers such decisions were made concerning their child without your knowledge. >>> Why Parents Need Choices in Education To Protect Their Values Americans should not accept the radical narrative that legislative proposals rejecting critical gender theory indoctrination are \"don’t say gay\" laws. Rather, some state lawmakers such as those in Florida have affirmed that a parent is a child’s primary caregiver and have a fundamental right to direct his or her upbringing. Legislators must require school officials to obtain parental permission for any medical procedure or counseling services for a minor student. State lawmakers around the country are considering parent bills of rights that have nothing to do with censorship. These proposals have everything to do with making sure school employees cannot divide children from their parents. If children are suffering from depression and struggling to understand their biological sex, then he or she needs empathy and counseling—and parents should be at beginning, middle, and end of such responses. Telling school leaders that they cannot keep secrets about a child from their parents is not censorship or discrimination. It is protection."},

School leaders should not be allowed to withhold information from parents about their children."], "text": "Special-interest groups don’t want parents to know when a student in Kansas public schools “identifies as” a gender not aligned with his or her biological sex. And school officials are prepared to keep this information from families, even when it involves children who are minors. Now, Kansas lawmakers are considering a proposal to create a parents’ bill of rights, similar to a proposal recently approved by Florida lawmakers. These parental bills of rights put parents back at the center of intimate questions regarding a child’s mental and physical health. The proposals also empower parents to make decisions as they protect their children from radical, explicit sexual teaching content—along with racially discriminatory material—being used in state public schools. Those proposals are essential for parents today. In December, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas sent an ominous letter to Kansas’ Olathe School District. The ACLU claimed that district and school officials cannot ask for parental consent before educators use a pronoun that children as young as middle schoolers—children aged 11 or 12, even—choose for themselves. The ACLU claims that even those young children can identify as a gender different from their biological sex and keep this information from their families. That means that the people closest to those children—their parents and family members—are prevented from helping them evaluate their feelings and emotions, and potentially exposing children to life-altering medical treatments. School officials in other districts have already decided to keep this information from parents. In the state capital, Topeka, the district adopted just such a policy in 2017. “School personnel,” it says, “should not disclose information that may reveal a student’s transgender status or gender nonconforming presentation to others, including parents.” Fortunately, state lawmakers are proposing to reinforce the truth that parents have the “right to direct the upbringing, education, care, and mental health of the parent’s child.” State officials are considering a parental bill of rights that includes not only the right to direct a child’s education, but also to guide a minor child’s moral and religious upbringing. The proposal includes key provisions being considered in many other states. For example, the Kansas proposal allows parents to “be informed of and inspect” the materials that educators use in the classroom. That way, parents can talk with their children about controversial topics before, during, and after they complete an assignment. Families can also object to material that is not age-appropriate for children. Lawmakers in Arizona and South Carolina, to name just two, are considering proposals that would allow parents to know what their children are being taught. That includes not just ideas related to gender, but also to race and ethnicity as well. Far too frequently, very young children—even students in kindergarten—are being forced to confront radical gender theories and ideas based in critical race theory that claim individuals oppress others based on the color of their skin. The Kansas proposal contains an important provision stating that no one should be compelled to affirm an idea that violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That strikes at critical race theory’s principle that individuals are to affirm that they are guilty of oppression based not on his or her actions, but only on his or her race or ethnicity. Critical race theorists, in fact, criticize the monumental 1964 Civil Rights Act and say it was only adopted to preserve the power of whites. Mississippi lawmakers recently approved a proposal that rejects racial discrimination by prohibiting individuals from being forced to profess or act on critical race theory’s bias in K-12 schools. The Kansas bill combines these elements. It restates the parents’ fundamental right to raise their children. It prevents school officials from hiding information from families. It rejects critical race theory’s noxious racial prejudice. And it requires schools to allow parents to participate with educators on what a child is taught and to control a child’s medical care in school. Lawmakers in at least a dozen states are considering these sorts of parental bills of rights. Indiana’s Attorney General’s Office has even released a guidebook explaining what rights are important to include and offering policy ideas to protect parental rights over medical and education decisions for their children. This is as it should be. School leaders should not be allowed to withhold information from parents about their children. State lawmakers must make sure public officials are not displacing families as the primary caregivers and decision-makers in a child’s life. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

There is no good reason to exchange a term clearly defined in law with a new ambiguous phrase."], "text": "Congress is considering several bills that would warp how the U.S. applies sanctions—through the Global Magnitsky Act—against foreigners who violate human rights. The changes would redefine human rights to enforce the left’s abortion-and-gender agenda. That would hobble the fight against real abuses of human rights. This problem has already appeared in trade bills related to Russia and Belarus. The legislation would replace the current definition of human rights abuses with a new undefined term. The current standard in the Global Magnitsky Act is “gross violation of human rights.” If revised, this would become “human rights abuses and corruption” or “serious human rights abuses.” But what is a human right? And which rights are we protecting? Currently, the Global Magnitsky Act uses the same definition as the 1961 Foreign Assistance Act. “Gross violations of internationally recognized human rights” mean: “torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, prolonged detention without charges and trial, causing the disappearance of persons by the abduction and clandestine detention of those persons, and other flagrant denial of the right to life, liberty, or the security of person.” All Americans can agree that those are gross human rights violations. And what about “internationally recognized human rights”? For these, the Global Magnitsky Act refers to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention Against Torture. These are the two binding international treaties to which the U.S. is a party. The U.S. has signed and ratified them, which makes them the law of the land. However, there are other human rights treaties that the U.S. has declined to join over many significant concerns. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child fall into that category. Those treaties could advance abortion rights, undermine parental rights, and infringe on national sovereignty. By applying new standards and definitions of what constitutes human rights abuses, would the “rights” enumerated in treaties that the U.S. has not ratified be included? In the last few decades, the left has invoked human rights to promote abortion and policies based on sexual orientation and gender identity. The Biden administration has followed suit. It often uses human rights language to pressure other countries to decriminalize “status or conduct” based on sexual orientation or gender identity. President Joe Biden issued a presidential memorandum in February 2021 that directed agencies of the U.S. government to “combat the criminalization by foreign governments of LGBTQI+ status or conduct” and to fight “discrimination, homophobia, transphobia, and intolerance.” But how will U.S. government agencies combat such discrimination and intolerance? And how will the U.S. pressure foreign governments to change their laws and cultural traditions governing sexual morality and biological understandings of male and female? If Congress expands the “gross violation” standard, this administration could use Global Magnitsky sanctions—or the threat of them—to achieve its goals. The 2021 presidential memorandum said as much: “agencies engaged abroad shall consider … the full range of diplomatic and assistance tools and, as appropriate, financial sanctions, visa restrictions, and other actions.” That would be a heavy cudgel in the arsenal of an administration intent on promoting gender ideology. It would obviate the need for other legislation that progressives have advanced to achieve these goals, such as the so-called Global Respect Act and the Globe Act. Similarly, it’s not hard to imagine that expanded Global Magnitsky language would target foreigners who seek to protect the unborn. The White House has been ardent in its support of abortion at home and abroad. Democrats in Congress have pushed legislation to remove abortion restrictions or codify abortion access. Internationally, influential voices from the World Health Organization to the United Nations’ human rights apparatus to Amnesty International insist that abortion is a human right. This claim is false, as a matter of both fact and international law. No international human rights treaty includes a right to abortion. But abortion proponents don’t get hung up on that inconvenient truth. Already countries that protect the unborn in their laws face extreme pressure from the United States and international groups to legalize abortion. Countries on the receiving end of such pressure campaigns range from Kenya to Ecuador to the Dominican Republic. Global Magnitsky sanctions could cripple pro-life politicians and religious leaders in these and other countries, like those that have joined the Geneva Consensus Declaration. And if other countries see the U.S. using sanctions to impose an ideological—and controversial—agenda, Global Magnitsky will become a much less effective instrument. As it is, the Global Magnitsky Act already deters or punishes human rights violators. There is no good reason to exchange a term clearly defined in law with a new ambiguous phrase. It’s not a far stretch from ambiguity to politicization. In that case, freedom of speech and freedom of religion—our most fundamental rights—will be the first casualties. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

But that’s not true."], "text": "Thursday, the final day of Women’s History Month, was dubbed the Transgender Day of Visibility by whatever star chamber makes up those sorts of things. Given the trans-saturated news, however, the day is about as necessary as calling for a Will Smith Day of Visibility on the morning after the Oscars. The fight between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and the Walt Disney Co. over the state’s just-signed Parental Rights in Education bill reached new levels. Disney called for the law to be repealed or struck down in court. Ron “always on offense” DeSantis decided to take a look at a special land exemption that Disney has enjoyed since 1967. And investigative reporter Chris Rufo released a Zoom video of an executive meeting with Disney’s most trans-credentialed employees gushing about their efforts to push “LGBTQIA+” themes in the company’s parks and movies—for kids. In the leaked video, executive producer Latoya Raveneau talked about the company’s “not-at-all-secret gay agenda” that involved “adding queerness” to kids’ entertainment. Disney General Entertainment President Karey Burke, the parent of “one transgender child and one pansexual child,” said she hoped for “many, many, many LGBTQIA characters in our stories.” Warning to State Attorneys General With such distracting news and video, you might have missed a related White House announcement. It plans to make trouble for states that protect kids from ghoulish interventions based on the myth that they are “born in the wrong body.” OK, that’s putting it bluntly. More precisely, President Joe Biden’s Justice Department has sent a letter to all state attorneys general warning that they could be violating civil rights laws if they keep minors from receiving “gender-affirming care.” Biden released a video message reinforcing the point. “To parents of transgender children,” he insisted, “affirming your child’s identity is one of the most powerful things you can do to keep them safe and healthy.” That’s a fog of cliches and euphemisms. After all, what is “gender-affirming care”? Wesley Smith, a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute, points to a guide just issued by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Population Affairs. It explains what the Biden administration means: That’s vague and bureaucratic. But the guide then spells things out: Fast Track to Sterilization An acquaintance describes this as the “school-to-sterilization pathway.” It starts with new pronouns and psychosocial training. Then it moves on to drugs and ends with surgery. That might involve literal castration for boys and double mastectomies and hysterectomies for girls. But cross-sex hormones can do the job without scalpel or knife—since those drugs can lead to sterility. “Gender-affirming” in this context, then, is really “sex-denying.” No cloud of verbal fog, no matter how thick, can obscure that brutal fact. This sex-denial is so bizarre that many still treat it as comical. In fact, it’s tragic: If they’re not put on this pathway, most kids who suffer gender dysphoria will grow out of it. Some 61% to 98% of these kids will naturally reconcile with their sex after going through puberty. In many cases, puberty itself may be the cure for gender dysphoria. But that healing can be thwarted if a child is socially transitioned at home and school, and put on puberty blockers and then cross-sex drugs. The further kids go down this pathway, the less likely they are to turn back. And the greater is the cost for those who detransition. That’s why some states have started to take notice. The best response to date is Arkansas’ SAFE Act. It prevents doctors from prescribing puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones, or performing surgeries on minors to “affirm gender identity.” That is, it stops doctors from sterilizing children before the age of consent. Biden opposes this. You read that right. The White House thinks that minors can consent to their own sterilization. And Biden’s Department of Health and Human Services claims that this is the proper standard of care for treating minors who struggle with their sexed bodies. Bad Science Of course, the White House claims the value of these “treatments” is based on good science. But that’s not true. A glance at the resources for the HHS document reveals a rogue’s gallery of gender ideologues. That  includes the Human Rights Campaign and the ACLU, alongside captured agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health’s Sexual and Gender Minority Research Office. The gender-transition pathway endorsed by Biden is based on a single, flawed Dutch study with 55 subjects and no control group. It’s no surprise then that countries such as the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Finland, who took early leads on the transition protocol, are hitting the brakes. And yet this is the moment when Biden has decided to put the full weight of the federal government on the accelerator for childhood gender transition. It’s now up to brave states and parents to stand in the way. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

These proposals follow increasing calls from parents to reject sexually explicit content unearthed in public school classrooms. The Parental Rights in Education law, recently signed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, sparked heated conversations throughout the nation regarding sex education and “gender ideology.” The Florida law addresses teacher conduct and material allowed in classrooms. It also postpones any teaching of sexual orientation and “gender identity” until after third grade. Other states, such as Alabama, have followed suit, addressing not just education, but the medical field as well. Thus far, schools and school boards have been the primary target of parental push back against radical gender ideology. However, the issue goes beyond one’s local public school district. The organizations that supply the curriculum and teacher training materials are just as important to examine. One such organization is the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States. This organization is a nonprofit devoted to sexual education advocacy. Along with tracking current and future legislation nationwide, the group publishes guidelines for grade school children and young adults. It partners with groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union, Advocates for Youth, and Planned Parenthood Federation of America to promote model legislation on “comprehensive sex education.” Since its beginning in 1964, the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States and its partners have been successful advocates for their cause. Through activism and political pressure, they have gained heavy influence in curriculum and government. They have advocated “gender-affirming” programs. They have also pushed opt-out bills as opposed to opt-in bills. That means parents must take their children out of a controversial class rather than place them in it. Parents are worried that this agenda not only exposes children to inappropriate content at early ages, but it also promotes lifestyles that are contrary to many parents’ values. But these activist groups have no intention of losing the ground that they have gained. They have denounced recent state proposals such as Florida’s. Take Eva Goldfarb and Lisa Lieberman, professors of public health at Montclair State University. In an online meeting, they suggested that the earlier in a child’s life that sex and gender topics are introduced into the curriculum, the better. In the same meeting, they encouraged the promotion of sexual topics in other subjects. “The fact that topics falling within sex education can be addressed successfully across the curriculum,” they said, “is encouraging.” And in the 2022 Legislative Look-Ahead, the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States condemns parental rights bills as “insidious,” promising to increase efforts to fight such proposals. Parents have been primarily taking on the public school system. However, to address the radical sexual orientation and gender identity agenda and other unsettling content, parents and concerned citizens should push for parental bills of rights. In a recent report, Heritage Foundation experts Jonathan Butcher and Lindsey Burke lay out what an ideal proposal would look like. They begin with changing the way schools view students in their care. According to the report, a parent bill of rights must affirm parents as the child’s primary caregivers. Parents are the ones “primarily responsible for their children’s education and health, as well as their moral and religious upbringing.” Students must also be protected from compelled speech and parents must have the final say regarding health and counseling services that are provided to their child. To directly address the curriculum developers, lawmakers and parents should push for transparency in the classroom. This transparency should not only include specifics about the curriculum, but who is providing the school with it. Parents have a right to know what is being taught to their children, and should have easy access to class syllabi, textbooks, homework, and reading materials. A school should make this easily accessible on its website and learning management system. Another avenue is supporting grassroots organizations like Parents Defending Education who are “fighting indoctrination in the classroom.” Many such groups diligently file Freedom of Information Act requests to expose explicit content and litigate on behalf of families. In addition to transparency, parents should enjoy far more school choice. This would give parents exit options when they don’t like what their children’s schools are teaching. This year alone, 27 states have put forward proposals for new school choice programs or the expansion of existing ones. Parents should have the choice to send their child—and their money—to the school that they believe aligns with their values.

In just the last few weeks, it’s made forays into social media, medical journals, and even federal legislation. For example, if you’ve spent much time on social media lately, you’ve likely seen the ACLU’s edits of a quote from Ruth Bader Ginsburg to remove offending references to “women.” Last October, Kamala Harris had no problem quoting an uncensored Ginsburg in the Senate confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett. But conventions on these delicate matters change fast. Eleven months later, the ACLU felt the need to strike the affronting words. The stunt stirred up enough controversy that the ACLU had to apologize. Executive Director Anthony Romero confessed that “it’s somewhat Orwellian to rewrite historical utterances to conform to modern sensitivities.” >>> Don’t Be Fooled: Gender Identity Policies Don’t Follow the Science Still, “having spent time with Justice Ginsburg,” explained Romero, “I would like to believe that if she were alive today, she would encourage us to evolve our language to encompass a broader vision of gender, identity, and sexuality.” In other words, while it may be best not to alter past quotes, we should avoid regressive references to “women” from now on. The Lancet’s September 25th cover is even more disturbing. It features a single, stark quote on white background, reducing women to “bodies with vaginas.” The medical journal, like the ACLU, has issued its half-hearted apology. They didn’t intend to dehumanize and marginalize women, explained Editor-in-Chief Richard Horton. Their goal, rather, is to “emphasize that transgender health is an important dimension of modern health care, but one that remains neglected.” He goes on and on in this exculpatory fashion, lamenting the scourge of “menstrual shame and period poverty.” Or, in the words of Demi Lovato: Sorry, not sorry. Both episodes have played out on social media. But there’s another erasure campaign underway in the shadows. Take, for instance, the Newspeak that has crept into the 2021 budget reconciliation bill now going through Congress. This sweeping tax-and-spend proposal would affect far more than just our fiscal health. Sex-specific words such as “women,” “females,” and “mothers” have gone missing in some of the very places you’d expect them—such as with “maternal mortality.” Instead, we discover awkward constructions, over and over, like “pregnant, lactating, and postpartum individuals and individuals with the intent to become pregnant.” Reconciliation packages are supposedly limited to budgets. But for gender ideologues, the process has become a chance to start erasing references to women and females. While “individual” or “person” is common in legal documents when the referent could be male or female, that doesn’t explain what’s happening here. The authors of this section intend to neuter references to women. How do we know? Because they’re departing from past usage, and even the typical usage still present here and there in the reconciliation text when referring to or quoting preexisting law. Take, for example, the Medicaid section, which must still refer to “pregnant and postpartum women.” It’s no surprise that a simple word search of existing law turns up 96 references to “pregnant women” already in the federal code. A search for “women” turns up 1,118 references. And then, just last month—with few precedents—this changes. This comes on top of other efforts to advance this Newspeak. For instance, Speaker Pelosi, early this year, made degendered language standard practice for Congress. Gender activists have pushed a sweeping piece of legislation—the misnamed Equality Act—which would enshrine their views in civil rights law. But as they work toward that goal, activists are focused on erasing women incrementally by slipping the same kind of language into bills moving through Congress now. >>> Economic Freedom Best Path to Women’s Equality, Empowerment These efforts are provoking resistance, however, and not just from committed traditionalists. Most Americans object to gender ideology. Whether it’s being pushed on minors in the doctor’s office or the sports arena, this is true. Hence the pushback to the flag-flying stunts from the ACLU and The Lancet. And why both groups had to issue apologies. The campaign also is facing resistance from non-conservative quarters. Atheists like Richard Dawkins have pushed back against the transgender ideology that inspires these language games. Many feminists, including radical feminists, also oppose it. Meanwhile, activists’ efforts are sporadic and contradictory. We see this even in the internal inconsistencies of the budget reconciliation bill text, as noted above. Finally, gender ideology contradicts natural reality. Not just the natural moral law written on every heart. We’re talking about mammalian biology. Hard facts like these should give us hope that common sense will prevail against gender activists’ efforts to erase women."},

But in 2021, $3.5 trillion tax-and-spend bill Democrats are trying to push through via the reconciliation process offers the chance for radical gender activists to slip the language and assumptions of their ideology into federal legislation. For instance, the text on “Maternal Mortality” (Part 4 of Subtitle J of Title III) consists of 15 sections that appropriate funds for a range of grants and programs for research and education on women’s health. And yet, in these sections discussing mothers who might face high-risk conditions related to childbearing, we find gender-neutral terminology repeated 18 times in more than half of the 15 sections: “pregnant, lactating, and postpartum individuals.” While “individual” or “person” is common in legal documents when the referent could be male or female, that doesn’t explain what’s happening here. The use of vague, ungendered terms is an attempt to make legal language compliant with an ideology that denies the innate binary of male and female. Subtitle J’s use of the generic “individuals” with “pregnant,” “lactating,” or “postpartum” is different even from the rest of the bill. A separate section on Medicaid, for instance, refers to “pregnant and postpartum women.” But in such cases, the bill is referring to past legislation that already uses the word “women,” such as the Violence Against Women Act, passed in 1994. Often this involves direct quotes from laws already on the books, so gender editors must leave the “offending” words in place. The trajectory is unmistakable: Whenever feasible, references to woman are being neutered. We’ve seen this Congress’ commitment to the woke left’s radical gender ideology since its opening days. In early January, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., made gender-neutral language standard practice for Congress. This approach persists even when the bill is dealing with topics unique to women. In 2021, opting to refer to a woman as a “pregnant, lactating, and postpartum individual” suggests that someone need not be a female to be pregnant, to lactate, or to suffer postpartum health complications. That is, of course, exactly the point. For certain radical gender activists, being a woman is more a function of nurture and self-designation than nature and biology. That language reflects that conviction. Alas, this woke language won’t just be kept in federal filing cabinets as an artifact of history. It will direct the spending of hundreds of millions of dollars. That direction can be painfully specific. For instance, Part 4 of Subtitle J appropriates funds that may be used to train America’s medical professionals. Section 31046 sets asides $85 million in competitive grants for eligible, accredited medical schools and programs that want to study the health effects of climate change on maternal mortality. Grantees must use those funds for curricula and continuing education. Those programs must focus on “identifying and addressing health risks and disparities associated with climate change, counseling, and mitigation strategies in addressing these risks and disparities.” But there’s an option for those less concerned about the role of changing global temperature averages on lactation. Medical schools can also use the funds to study “implicit and explicit bias, racism, and discrimination in providing care to pregnant, lactating, and postpartum individuals and individuals with the intent to become pregnant.” Of course, in the abstract, funding to develop curricula on discrimination and bias toward “pregnant, lactating, and postpartum individuals” might sound nice. But let’s not be naive about its effect, which is to impose curricula committed to gender ideology through the power of the federal purse. It would do this under the cover of preventing “discrimination.” Whether this funding could improve the well-being of pregnant women or mothers, the insertion of such gender-neutral language signals that this is about far more than helping mothers. Rather, it’s about injecting a woman-erasing ideology into society from the federal level. Activists have sought to advance this cause through the sweeping Equality Act, which would enshrine gender ideology in civil rights law. But they’re also exploiting every chance to erase references to women—from civil society and the classroom to the executive branch. Wary legislators and legislative staff should reject these efforts to advance radical gender ideology incrementally—and expose it to the light of day before it finds its way further into the language of our laws.

"], "text": "Children are being targeted with sexual content—not just in social media, but also in school curriculums. As with other recent controversies, however, leaders in Florida are fighting back. Lawmakers in the Sunshine State have introduced a new bill, Parental Rights in Education. If the name doesn’t ring a bell, that may be because big media have mislabeled it as the “Don’t Say Gay” Bill. The bill would not ban the word “gay.” Rather, it would protect children from teachers and other school officials who seek to sexualize and bombard them with gender ideology. In particular, it would require schools to be transparent with and get permission from parents for any health services students receive. It would also prohibit elementary school teachers from pushing classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity. Liberal activists are claiming that the parental rights bill would harm kids. Nonsense. It would protect young kids from what is, in effect, sexual grooming—whether in the classroom or the nurse’s office. The fact that this has become a partisan issue is a sign of how bizarre our culture and politics have become. In recent years, sexually explicit and age-inappropriate material have flooded America’s classrooms. For example, last year in Washington state, a first-grade teacher read students “I Am Jazz”—an infamous children’s book that promotes transgenderism. Sexually Explicit Content Harms Kids Anyone with common sense knows that we should protect young children from sexual content. Scientific evidence confirms that wisdom. We know that early exposure to sexual content can harm young students. It has been linked to poor “mental health, life satisfaction, sexual behavior and attitudes, and pornography-viewing patterns in adulthood.” Decent schools used to know that kids need visual and intellectual space to flourish and mature into healthy, balanced adults. Unfortunately, times have changed. Schools are now often a pipeline for sexualizing kids as young as kindergarten. The fact that activist-educators do this in the name of “compassion” or “gender equity” doesn’t change what’s really happening. Bad Medicine What’s more, the fashionable gender ideology peddled by many schools is contrary to the best medical evidence. According to the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 88% to 98% of those struggling with gender dysphoria will reconcile with their biological sex after going through puberty. Trendy gender interventions can prevent this healing and set children of a lifelong path of surgeries, hormone treatments, costly and painful medical treatment, and physical illness. That’s the problem with all three stages of the transition trifecta—puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgery. But even prior social transition can lead to harm. If a girl spends her teen years presenting and imagining herself as a boy, she will be more likely to take the next steps on the path to gender “transition.” She won’t get those years back, even if she changes her mind. She will be out of sync with her peers. Then there’s the physical harm. Puberty blockers have been shown to reduce bone density, which can lead to lifelong problems. Cross-sex hormones can sterilize those who receive them. And removing sex organs is just sterilization—full stop. Parents have the most interest and incentive to weigh the options, the risks, and the irreversible, life-altering consequences of these methods. A healthy culture recognizes that parents—not teachers and school nurses—have the chief responsibility for helping their children who struggle with their sexed bodies. Transparency Of course, there’s honest debate about what is age-appropriate and about what is the best treatment for those with gender dysphoria. So, in short, who should decide: teachers, administrators, or parents? The Florida bill sides with parents—as it should. That’s why much of it is about transparency for parents. Parents can then decide when, if, and how their kids will be exposed to sexually explicit content and referred for therapy and medical treatment. In a normal world, a law mandating transparency wouldn’t be needed. Teachers would share the values and priorities of the parents in their communities. Today, however, many public schools treat parents as hostile and reactionary impediments to gender indoctrination. Those schools aid and abet in the “social transition” of kids who request it—using and enforcing “preferred pronouns” and the like—while hiding it from parents. Parents in Wisconsin and Florida are currently suing their school districts for doing just that. Such deception strikes at the natural bond between parents and their children. Moms and dads, not teachers and principals, know their children best. Moms and dad have the right and responsibility to raise their children. They may delegate some of the details to schools, but that does not mean they give up their prerogatives. The new Florida bill recognizes the well-being of children and the right of their parents to raise and teach them. Other states should ignore the liberal media trolls and follow Florida’s lead.

Expert Calls for Countries to Embrace Radical Gender Theory", "author": ["Grace  Melton"], "date": "Nov 4, 2021 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/un-expert-calls-countries-embrace-radical-gender-theory", "takeaways": ["Gender theory is another woke ideology which, among other things, considers the categories of “male” and “female” to be oppressive stereotypes.", "Madrigal-Borloz is promoting an ideology that conflicts with internationally recognized rights and is opposed by many religions and cultures around the world.", "U.N. delegates should reject the infusion of radical gender theory into the human rights framework and work to protect the unalienable human rights of all."], "text": "Victor Madrigal-Borloz, the United Nation’s independent expert on sexual orientation and gender identity, delivered his latest report to the U.N. General Assembly last week that should set off alarm bells around the world. The report concludes that the world must choose between a path of “exclusionary narratives” advanced by “ultraconservative political leaders and religious groups” that perpetuate violence and discrimination, or a path of inclusivity guided by “gender theory” and human rights. Gender theory is another woke ideology—an outgrowth of feminism and critical theory—which, among other things, considers the categories of “male” and “female” to be oppressive stereotypes. While these U.N. reports may seem like meaningless ivory tower rhetoric, they contribute to a growing body of quasi-legal documents that legislators and even Supreme Court justices can invoke, paving the way for radical progressive policy to reenter American policy, law, and politics. Not only do these ideas creep into the American legal body, but they also embolden those who seek to change traditional cultures around the world through ideological colonialism. In this case, the left is pushing a radical view of gender that’s inconsistent with the religious beliefs and practices of many countries—and speech-control for those who disagree. It’s dangerous advice that undermines the idea of fundamental human rights based upon inherent human dignity. How Leftists Are Defining “Gender” in International Human Rights Law The word “gender” does not appear in the foundational documents of human rights law, namely the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. When the landmark international conference on women’s empowerment, known as the Fourth World Conference on Women, approved its “platform for action” document in Beijing in 1995, it clarified that its use of “gender” was “intended to be interpreted and understood as it was in ordinary, generally accepted usage”—that is, a synonym for biological sex. This commonsense, biology-based approach has guided diplomats since the U.N.’s founding in 1945. It’s what they used as they negotiated and agreed to treaties and documents that used the word “sex” to refer plainly to male and female, and later terms like “gender equality” to refer to equality between the sexes. But all that is at risk if this report takes hold. Gender Ideology Threatens Existing Human Rights Under the guise of advancing human rights, Madrigal-Borloz is promoting an ideology that conflicts with internationally recognized rights and is opposed by many religions and cultures around the world. He refers to those who oppose his progressive views as promoting “practices of exclusion,” but this is false. There is nothing more inclusive than grounding human rights on the firm footing of inherent human dignity, which we all equally possess. Those promoting policies or rights based on membership in a particular identity group rely on expansive terms like “intolerance” and “discrimination,” and conflate disagreement with discrimination, or discrimination with violence. Madrigal-Borloz’s insistence that gender is a protected category in international human rights law and, by extension, that gender identity and gender expression are similarly protected, is a claim found in the controversial Yogyakarta Principles, a project of activists to advance a radical view of gender identity through the international human rights framework. These progressive activists demand that countries implement policies that they see as advancing their vision, such as decriminalizing consensual sexual behaviors, “sex work,” and abortion, among many other policies that most U.N. member states reject. And on top of these radical views, Madrigal-Borloz’s report recommends applying the legal framework of hate speech and hate crimes to those opposing “rights related to gender and sexuality, comprehensive gender and sexuality education, bodily autonomy, sexual and reproductive rights and legal recognition of gender identity.” This could easily describe adherents of many faith traditions. And “applying the legal framework of hate speech and hate crimes” suggests that individuals could face fines, jail, or other penalties for saying that their faith—or even science—doesn’t support progressive views on the nature of men and women. These types of cases have already begun to appear in Western countries that embrace gender ideology. Such efforts by U.N. “experts” to bully countries into changing their views of gender and to enshrine this view into law will cause friction in many countries, especially in Muslim- or Christian-majority societies. U.N. delegates should reject the infusion of radical gender theory into the human rights framework and work to protect the unalienable human rights of all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation, identity, or any other category.

They include girls who must compete against males and share private spaces with them.", "Critics of gender theory might want to find out what these groups of Americans really think and craft their own strategy for appealing to them."], "text": "A new, glossy messaging document reveals the plans of left-wing groups to sell American voters on gender theory. “Transgender Youth and the Freedom to Be Ourselves” is the joint product of the Transgender Law Center, ASO Communications, and Lake Research Partners. It seeks to provide Democrats with talking points to shore up their base, gain new allies, and counter critics. The central plank of the group’s strategy, as Mary Margaret Olohan reports, is to “weave together” a “Race Class Gender Narrative.” Linking gender to race and class makes rhetorical sense. Most Americans believe that all men and women—black or white, rich or poor—are created equal. If gender activists can tie their ideas to racial and class equality in the minds of most Americans, they will likely achieve their goals. But this “race class gender” strategy may be too clever by half. It’s doubtful that many, let alone most, minorities and working voters buy into gender theory. Gender activists seek to replace biological reality, in our laws and institutions, with a fluid notion of “gender identity.” Broadening the Base Biased judges may deliver this wish without the bother of elections. More likely, gender activists will need to win over majorities to make it happen. The authors of this new report know this. “Using a Race Class Gender Narrative,” they write, “we can mobilize our progressive base (particularly Black, AAPI, and Gen Z audiences), marginalize our opposition, and move persuadables across race.” The progressive base is already persuaded, though, as are many Gen Zers who have been subject to years of gender propaganda. But what about minorities and working Americans? The report suggests that for Democrats to expand their support, they must “tell a convincing story of how our opposition uses strategic racism and transphobia to harm us all.” A Hard Sell? This could be a hard sell. The past struggles of racial minorities and the working poor are vastly different from the “struggles,” such as they are, related to gender. Yes, some people are distressed with their biological sex. We should treat them with compassion. And they should enjoy the same legal protections as everyone else. But the debate over gender theory is not about that. It’s about an ideology that occupies the commanding heights of culture—unlike working-class Americans now, and many minorities in the past. The critics of gender theory are far more likely to be marginalized or canceled than are its champions. Indeed, the victims of this ideology are becoming harder and harder to hide. They include girls who must compete against males and share private spaces with them. They include thousands of children who have been convinced, by schools and social media “influencers,” that they are born in the wrong body. Many have fallen under the spell of “rapid onset gender dysphoria.” The victims also include anguished parents. They struggle to protect their sons and daughters from life-changing hormones and scalpels, from woke teachers, therapists, doctors, and even government officials. A Heritage Foundation poll last year found that most Americans oppose the key planks of the gender agenda. Will most minorities and working-class Americans, wooed by a few rhetorical tricks, embrace the ideologues who are clearly the victimizers, rather than the victims? An Elite Fixation I’m skeptical. Gender ideology seems to be an elite fixation of upper- and upper-middle class college grads. It’s likely baffling to ordinary people, including the roughly two-thirds of American adults who lack a bachelor’s degree. Take the mind-bending neologisms and pronouns. References to “women” give way to degrading euphemisms like “bodies with vaginas,” “non-prostate owners,” and “cervix owners.” Those who identify as “gender fluid” often state their preferred pronouns as “they/them”—as do a full third of the staff of the Transgender Law Center. One staff member identifies as “queer trans femme.” What gender theory means in practice is far worse. It means that any male who identifies as female should get to compete against females—in all-girl sports. By the same incantation, male students can use girls’ bathrooms and locker rooms in K-12 schools. Male rapists can be relocated to women’s prisons. ;Doctors and nurses could be forced against their consciences to administer cross-sex hormones and remove healthy organs. How many Chinese immigrants know what “queer trans femme” means? How keen is the average plumber, UPS driver, housekeeper, construction worker, or landscaper to make sure high school males who identify as female get to shower with the girls? How eager is the typical black cop for public schools to make sure gender-confused kids get access to cross-sex hormones, against their parents’ wishes? How many Mexican American farmers, or cowboys, or restauranteurs want to know your preferred pronouns? How many of them would rejoice if their own daughters suddenly announced that they were boys, or their sons, girls? It’s tempting to guess, but we don’t know the answers to these questions. The consultants behind “Transgender Youth and the Freedom to Be Ourselves” hope that with the right marching orders, minorities and working-class voters will become docile foot soldiers in the long march of gender theory. Critics of gender theory might want to find out what these groups of Americans really think and craft their own strategy for appealing to them. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},
{"title": "Congress Should Respect Human Rights by Rejecting HR 3485", "author": ["Grace  Melton"], "date": "Jan 10, 2022 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/religious-liberty/commentary/congress-should-respect-human-rights-rejecting-hr-3485", "takeaways": ["This bill is part of an ongoing campaign by the left to commit the U.S. government to advance gender ideology, deprioritizing religious freedom and free speech.", "Increasingly the left is attempting to use the legal system as a weapon to force individuals to endorse a woke orthodoxy against their conscience.", "U.S. policy should maintain that existing approach, which protects individual human rights, including the rights to religious freedom and freedom of speech."], "text": "The House of Representatives is preparing to vote on the so-called Global Respect Act (HR 3485), which would impose sanctions on foreigners, including private citizens, who are determined to be responsible for human rights violations against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or intersex individuals. While the concept sounds positive (after all, who wants to see anyone’s human rights violated?), in fact, this bill is part of an ongoing campaign by the left to commit the U.S. government to advance gender ideology, deprioritizing religious freedom and the free speech rights of those who think outside an increasingly radical, woke framework. President Joe Biden last year committed the U.S. government to do just that in any work the U.S. undertakes abroad, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s decision to bring this bill to a vote is the next step. Congress should reject HR 3485. It undermines religious liberty and freedom of speech by advancing a far-left, controversial gender ideology that amounts to ideological colonialism against countries and cultures that uphold traditional beliefs. And it risks undermining the foundations of the human rights system long supported by America and freedom lovers around the world by replacing a vision of unalienable rights available to everyone with one rooted in identity politics. It’s also unnecessary. The Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act and other human rights statutes already provide for imposing visa restrictions and other sanctions on international human rights violators, regardless of the abusers’ rationale for committing abuses. Moreover, the U.S. has ratified the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which since 1948 has specifically guaranteed in Article 18 “the right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion,” which includes the freedom “to manifest [one’s] religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship, and observance.” HR 3485 would therefore be duplicative and needlessly create conflict with religious liberty and freedom of expression considerations. The U.S. has long supported international religious freedom, including in the 1998 bipartisan passage and continued support of the International Religious Freedom Act. That commitment would be undermined if the House were to pass HR 3485 next week. That’s because not far beneath the surface of the left’s approach to human rights is a profound intolerance of biblical or other traditional religions, particularly with respect to how those faith traditions view human sexuality. For many progressives, the belief that marriage is solely the union of one man and one woman is considered discriminatory or “homophobic,” and the conviction that there are only two biological sexes is narrow-minded or “transphobic.” But Orthodox Christians, Jews, and Muslims have professed those beliefs for millennia. And now, when they publicly express such views, they are accused of intolerance, discrimination, and even hate speech. Increasingly the left is attempting to use the legal system as a weapon to force individuals to endorse a woke orthodoxy against their conscience. Internationally, voices are calling for the criminalization of speech that doesn’t align with the left’s ideological-purity tests for how to talk about families, human biology, or sexual morality. For example, last year, a U.N. independent expert, Victor Madrigal-Borloz, issued a report calling for countries to apply the legal framework of hate speech and hate crimes in order to promote “rights related to gender and sexuality, comprehensive gender and sexuality education, bodily autonomy, sexual and reproductive rights, and legal recognition of gender identity.” HR 3485 creates an opportunity for leftist activists to use the U.S. government to target political and ideological opponents. The bill’s broad language and lack of protections to safeguard religious liberty and freedom of speech invite ample opportunities for abuse. In a world where even “Harry Potter” author J.K. Rowling can be attacked for observing the potential for gender ideology to hurt women, it is not a stretch to imagine that the legislation’s undefined terms, such as “complicity,” “inciting,” and “cruel” or “degrading” treatment, could be applied to pastors, rabbis, or imams preaching against what their faiths consider to be sexual sins. Or against a concerned mother seeking to protect her gender-dysphoric child from a school’s or medical authorities’ attempts to “transition” him or her away from his or her biological sex. Even Pope Francis’ explanation of the Catholic Church’s teachings on marriage and sexuality could be considered by some to be “cruel treatment” under this legislation. Would the bill’s sponsors want to deny him a visa to enter the United States? Creating or recognizing rights based on membership in special identity groups erodes America’s long-held understanding that foundational principles of equality and universality underpin human rights. While HR 3485 refers to “internationally recognized human rights,” international law is largely silent on special rights awarded on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity, such as same-sex marriage or adoption. However, the left continues its efforts to redefine and reinterpret existing human rights treaties, including at the U.N. The U.S. should not ignore the plight of individuals who suffer violence or cruelty at the hands of governments in any circumstance, but laws already exist to address those situations. U.S. policy should maintain that existing approach, which protects individual human rights, including the rights to religious freedom and freedom of speech. Congress should reject the idea that America needs HR 3485 to respect human rights around the globe. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

Hopefully, this has at least given you pause. Arina Grossu, director of the Center for Human Dignity at the Family Research Council, correctly describes these experiments on rats as “Frankenscience.” It’s our moral duty to draw the line. This is something the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative certainly wasn’t willing to do, as it endorsed the study. Why on Earth would scientists be doing this? Can any helpful scientific advancement be achieved through this experiment? One possible answer: It is a vast overstep of scientific curiosity. As Jeff Goldblum said in “Jurassic Park,” “Scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn’t stop to think if they should.” If this experiment was done simply because they could, it is a very bleak sign. The scientific community sees moral objections to mutilation as an obstacle to be overcome, not a parameter to stay within. Sadly, the motivations may be even darker. This experiment is a direct step toward the maiming of human males so they are able to carry children. There is no other logical reasoning for why such a study would be undertaken other than to eventually be developed for use on humans. It is common for experimental surgical treatments to be practiced on rodents before humans. The ramifications for this would be extreme. Would the development of such a procedure lead to doctors being encouraged to implant uteri into biological males who identify as females so they are able to gestate children? This is just one of many questions that could and should be asked about this study and where they hope for it to lead. Currently, the science seems to be very far off from impregnating human males. But more importantly, should we even be trying to do this? In short, absolutely not. It is unethical to mutilate men and women’s bodies to try and force them to do something they were never designed to do. We cannot go down this road that has the potential to harm future generations. Transgender medicine, particularly in children, is already a highly contentious issue that has been rapidly disseminated by the radical left as the only option. It isn’t. And this experiment shows it has no plan of slowing down. In fact, the left is eager to make this happen. It even goes so far as to say equitable access to uterine transplants for transwomen is a “moral imperative.” Surgically combining two rats in an attempt to impregnate a male does not advance humanity. Pseudo-science like this corrodes ethical principles and throws more skepticism at what is considered morally acceptable. These kinds of research projects should never be allowed to take place in our country or be funded by American tax dollars. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal."},

Kendi announced on a podcast that his kindergarten-age daughter told him and his wife that she wanted to become a boy. Kendi and his wife were “horrified” and wondered what sort of messages she had been hearing about “girlhood” that would cause her to shun her sex. This reaction went viral, and many decried his reaction as hypocritical and “un-woke.” In his unguarded moment, Kendi sounded less like a revolutionary and more like a father wanting to protect his daughter. Growing numbers of fathers and mothers across the country are experiencing the same shock when their daughters say they no longer want to be girls. But unlike Kendi, they have not become rich and famous promoting “critical theory.” Their daughters, and Kendi’s, are all experiencing the downstream impact of gender theory. Like CRT, gender theory (and queer theory) emerged from universities and have been propelled into the mainstream by identity politics. Gender theory rejects any relationship between biology and gender as “biological essentialism.” According to Judith Butler, one of the most prominent voices in gender theory, both the biological reality of sex and gender (the way one expresses being male or female) are social constructs. Male and female are roles that are “performed.” Therefore, gender (and the body itself) can be reconstructed otherwise. That can has become a dogma that progressives insist others must accept. This latest iteration of the sexual revolution is profoundly destructive to children and threatens the rights of parents to determine the upbringing of their children. But unbeknownst to most parents, political lobbying organizations and “woke capital” are transforming medicine and education into fields for transgender activism. One mother, who speaks under the pseudonym “Elaine,” described what happened when her 15-year-old daughter wanted to “transition.” She recounted how experts treated her daughter’s distress with “a one size fits-all narrative that has no basis in science, common sense, or compassion.” The narrative is known as “affirmative care,” (hormonal and surgical interventions on minors to affirm gender identity). It limits counselors and doctors to “affirming” that boys are trapped in girls’ bodies, and vice-versa, even in children as young as 4 years old. Calling it “a lie that is tearing families apart,” Elaine described being powerless in the face of doctors who encouraged her daughter to undergo irreversible intervention on her body. In states like Oregon, 15 year-olds don’t need parental approval to consent to sex-change surgery. Twenty states also ban talk therapy for gender dysphoria, meaning that counselors are forbidden from questioning a child as to whether he or she is actually “trapped in the wrong body.” LGBTQ advocates mischaracterize discussions of feelings about gender and sexuality as akin to “conversion therapy,” which employs high pressure techniques to convince homosexuals that they are not gay. As a result, counselors and therapists who treat gender dysphoria are refusing patients out of a fear of being sued or even prosecuted. >>> We’ll Tell You What “60 Minutes+” Won’t About How Transgender Movement Endangers Kids Elaine asks why doctors are allowed to mutilate healthy reproductive organs. Transgender activists have influenced the nation’s leading educational and medical organizations into accepting a warped understanding of the relation of mind and body. As at an amusement park, where funhouse mirrors disorient children by distorting their reality, transgender activists present exaggerated images of femininity and masculinity to children. They teach that preferences for the outward signals of gender—such as dresses or short haircuts—indicate a child’s “true” gender identity associated with the respective style. Drag queens are invited to read stories in schools and libraries. The Barbie doll physical ideal has been held up to scrutiny and criticism from feminists for decades, but now adult men emulate its appearance in their performances. Ironically, gender theory now reinforces hyper-feminine and masculine physiques, costumes, makeup, and mannerisms. Like traditional stereotypes, these false images distort boys’ and girls’ expectations of themselves, but with far more serious consequences. Because gender theory asserts that the body can be amended to match self-perception, doctors treat gender dysphoria unlike other disorders related to body image (such as anorexia nervosa, which has clear diagnostic criteria related to body image). With other mental disorders, doctors seek to address the underlying problems that have led to an inaccurate or harmful self-image. Normally, doctors and counselors don’t affirm the distorted self-images of their patients. Rather than telling girls who like sports and the outdoors to undergo permanent disfiguration, counselors and doctors could expand the parameters of girlhood beyond dresses and baking. And boys who like the arts and fashion could be accepted as they are, not told that they are girls trapped in the wrong body. In Europe, the tide is turning. Recently, the United Kingdom’s High Court heard a lawsuit from Keira Bell, a 24-year-old woman who regrets following the advice of doctors at the Tavistock Clinic to take puberty blockers and have a double mastectomy. Bell recalls being socially isolated, identifying as a “butch lesbian,” and being introduced to transsexualism through social media. She laments that doctors did not address her underlying mental health issues and challenge her belief that life would improve through gender transition. The High Court held that children under 16 lack the capacity to give informed consent to puberty blockers for treatment of gender dysphoria because they are too young to understand the side effects. The leading hospital in Sweden has ended the use of puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria for anyone under 18. Similarly, Finland’s guidelines for treatment of gender dysphoria now support psychological therapy to treat the underlying disorder over interventions on the body. But doctors in America, including those suing to overturn the nation’s first puberty blocker ban, persist in telling families that children are at greater risk if they undergo “watchful waiting” than if they receive injections of hormones or have surgeries to remove their reproductive organs. The burden of proof should rest with those who want to try experimental therapies, especially on children. Yet the advice of American doctors (including new U.S. Assistant Secretary for Health, Rachel (formerly Richard) Levine) rests on two unproven assertions: that puberty suppression is reversible, and there are mental health benefits to gender affirmation. But there is no supporting evidence for these claims. How Woke Gender Captured Medical Standards of Care In a groundbreaking article in The New Atlantis entitled “Growing Pains,” Paul W. Hruz, Lawrence S. Mayer, and Paul R. McHugh, experts in endocrinology, psychiatry, and epidemiology, described how the largest LGBT lobbying organization, the Human Rights Campaign and World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) influenced medical organizations like the Endocrine Society and the American Academy of Pediatrics to embrace gender affirmation over the last two decades. Jason Pierceson, author of Sexual Minorities and Politics, explains that “political activism and consciousness raising has also changed the way in which the medical community views transgender persons.” He describes how this activism led the American Psychiatric Association to “abandon the mental illness paradigm of transgenderism” by changing the description in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) to treat only the stress associated with gender dysphoria as a mental disorder. No breakthroughs in science or medicine led to the change, which was accomplished just by political activism. Hruz and his coauthors explains that longstanding practices that are employed to protect patients from the harms of experimental medicine (including human subjects protections, the use of institutional review boards, and carefully controlled clinical trials, and long-term follow-up studies) are almost entirely absent from the use of puberty-blocking treatments for gender dysphoria. A recent Economist article also reported the absence of a single large study of the effectiveness of puberty blockers. The assertion that puberty suppression is reversible is unproven. And, as the New Atlantis authors point out, a course of puberty blockers followed by cross-sex hormones circumvents the maturation of reproductive organs, rendering children permanently sterile. Although 88 percent to 98 percent of gender dysphoric children who naturally go through puberty become reconciled to their bodies, according to the DSM-5, Hruz, Mayer, and McHugh explain that gender-affirming treatments “may drive some children to persist in identifying as transgender when they might otherwise have…found their gender to be aligned with their sex.” They question whether the persistence of gender dysphoria in 100 percent of children who were treated at a well-known Dutch clinic with puberty blockers (at age 12) and continuing with cross-sex hormones (at age 16) may have been a self-fulfilling prophecy. If 100 percent of patients at a clinic for eating disorders went on to have surgical interventions, one would expect intense scrutiny from the medical establishment. But there are no political lobbying organizations calling for the affirmation of disordered eating. Transgender advocates also fail to provide evidence of improved mental health from affirmative care. The American Journal of Psychiatry recently issued a correction to an earlier study that admitted that the largest dataset on transgender-identifying patients demonstrated no advantage of surgery in relation to subsequent mood or anxiety disorder-related health care. The adoption of the affirmative care model by the American Academy of Pediatrics and Endocrine Society occurred simultaneously with dramatic increases in the number of children identifying as transgender. The confluence of these events has caused observers to question whether the sudden increase is the result of social contagion. In the UK, there was a 4,400 percent increase in young women identifying as gender dysphoric between 2008 and 2018. A 2016 survey found that as many as 3 percent of American high schoolers may believe that their gender identity is different than their sex, remarkably higher than the 0.6 percent of adults who identify as transgender. And the number of American girls seeking transition surgery quadrupled from 2016 to 2017. This sudden rise in girls identifying as transgender was identified as Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria (ROGD) in a 2018 article in PLOS One, a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Brown University physician and medical researcher Lisa Littman found that girls were especially vulnerable to social contagion from friends and teachers who are heroized for transgender identities. Under intense criticism from the transgender community, the editor of the journal issued an apology and correction even there were no substantive challenges to the results of Littman’s research. Similarly, other medical professionals have been “cancelled” for raising concerns about dangers to children. Allan Josephson, the former head of the University of Louisville’s Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychology, was demoted from his position after activists in the university protested his questioning of affirmative care for children at a Heritage Foundation event. In England, the Tavistock Clinic fired David Bell (no relation to Keira) after he wrote an internal report finding that “children’s needs are being met in a woeful, inadequate manner and some will live on with the damaging consequences.” The power of the transgender lobby is magnified by the willingness of major corporations to silence critics of affirmative care. Target banned Abigail Shrier’s book Irreversible Damage, the Transgender Craze Seducing our Girls,” Amazon banned Ryan T. Anderson’s book When Harry Became Sally. Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook have all removed content that challenges the narrative of the transgender movement. This year, Arkansas legislators passed a ban on the experimental use of puberty blockers, cross sex-hormones, and surgeries on children to treat gender dysphoria despite opposition from the Walton Family Foundation (Walmart’s philanthropic arm). The legislature overrode Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson’s veto of the Save Adolescents from Experimentation (SAFE Act). Citing Ronald Reagan and William F. Buckley Jr., Hutchison inappositely defended his veto on the grounds that the government should not legislate on matters involving parents and children. Yet, the government’s compelling interest in the health and safety of minors is why it is unlawful for parents to consent to children undergoing genital mutilation, receiving piercings or tattoos, driving, or consuming alcohol. Republican and Democratic lawmakers in 15 states and the U.S. Congress are also seeking to protect children with similar bills. From Safe Spaces to Woke Schools Maria Keffler, co-founder of Partners for Ethical Care, a grassroots group that publicizes the dangers of gender ideology, points to the LGBT activist group Gender Spectrum’s four “entry points” for getting gender policy into schools: Internal (challenging binary thinking about sex); Interpersonal (creating a “counternarrative” to the sex binary using gender-neutral pronouns and challenge any association between being a girl or a boy and a child’s interests); Instructional (using books, media, lesson plans, curriculum and posters that challenge heterosexuality and cisgender norms; and Institutional (adopting transgender policies in private spaces like bathrooms and locker rooms). As Keffler points out, the infusion of gender ideology into schools is insidious because “kids trust trusted adults.” But schools aren’t merely telling students to trust gender ideology. They are also telling children not to trust their parents if they won’t affirm the new gender narrative. Educators may encourage students to “socially transition” at school by dressing in clothes of the opposite sex. Schools may keep a separate file hidden from parents that uses the child’s preferred pronoun and a name that differs from their legal name. In the Madison, Wisconsin school district, concerned parents filed a lawsuit on the grounds that this policy violates their parental rights. In addition, the Human Rights Campaign and GLSEN (the Gay, Lesbian, Straight Education Network) infuse instruction on gender with the framework of critical theory and its narratives of “structural oppression” and “power and privilege.” Students are taught that if they are comfortable being a boy or girl they are members of an “oppressor group” (the cisgendered) and that belief in the sex binary is a form of bigotry and bullying. Lesson plans in the Human Rights Campaign’s “Welcoming Schools” program teach elementary students to identify each other by their gender identity, defined as “How you feel. Girl, boy, both or neither.” A video in the program characterizes a parent as a “troll” for voicing concerns about the book “I Am Jazz” (about a boy who seeks to transition to being a girl). The infusion of gender ideology into all aspects of education from the classroom to the cafeteria, from the locker room to the gymnasium puts pressure on children to conform. As Mary Hasson of the Ethics and Public Policy Center suggests that a school environment that makes a student feel that his or her views about biological sex are wrong or “bigoted” effectively denies that child the right to an education. >>> Seven Steps to Combatting “Critical Theory” in the Classroom As in medicine, the Human Rights Campaign has the full support of gatekeeping organizations, including the National Education Association and the American Library Association. Other major political organizations, like Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Southern Poverty Law Center, also promote the adoption of gender identity curricula in schools. Human Rights Campaign’s efforts to “queer” schools is bolstered by its ability to create LGBTQ “standards” in every area of life. Through its rankings in a wide variety of industries, it has enlisted corporations like Wells Fargo to support the Welcoming Schools plan. The Human Rights Campaign also boasts of its Business Coalition for the Equality Act with 394 corporate members representing a combined $6.5 trillion in revenue. By amending the 1964 Civil Rights Act to add protected classes for gender identity, the Equality Act would codify gender theory in medicine and education. Under similar state laws, transgender activists have sued hospitals for declining to perform hysterectomies on healthy women to affirm their gender identities. Passage of the Equality Act would not only have a chilling effect on doctors and counselors, it would impose gender ideology in public schools and private schools that receive federal funds, including faith-based schools. The Equality Act could also lead courts to impose gender identity curricula, even though a recent survey of parents and schoolboard members by Braun Research (commissioned by the Heritage Foundation) showed that 66 percent of parents oppose it. In addition, 10 states have explicitly prohibited curricula on gender identity. How Woke Gender Undoes the Family Ultimately, gender ideology drives wedges between children and their parents. As Prof. Melissa Moschella has explained, disagreements over treatment for gender dysphoria have led judges to remove children from the custody of parents who opposed hormonal interventions. The Supreme Court has affirmed that parents have a fundamental and pre-political right to direct the education and upbringing of their children in Meyer v. Nebraska and Pierce v. Society of Sisters. This is rooted in their biological connection and the responsibility that it creates. Yet, gender ideology has so permeated American culture and law that parents who question it now risk challenges from the government. For parents to succeed in protecting children from “woke” gender ideology, they will need to do political battle. Like critical race theory, gender theory has entered pediatricians’ offices and classrooms through the work of political activists. Doctors, teachers, and lawmakers who want to protect children will continue to be trampled by the transgender lobby and “woke capital” until parents provide reinforcements. By vanquishing the threats of legal punishment and “cancel culture,” parents can stop schools and hospitals from luring more confused children into the horrors of the gender industry."},

Here Are Its 5 Biggest Flaws.", "author": ["Sarah Parshall Perry", "Jessica  Anderson"], "date": "Feb 15, 2022 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/violence-against-woman-act-back-its-still-no-better-here-are-its-5-biggest-flaws", "takeaways": ["In the very spaces where women need protection the most, they would be forced to share intimate spaces with men who identify as women if this bill is enacted.", "The Senate hasn’t justified carve-outs for “underserved populations,” and to include, for example, nonbinary individuals or homosexual men alongside women.", "The 2022 Violence Against Women Act reauthorization does nothing to protect the interests of biological women, equality, the unborn, or the rule of law."], "text": "The Violence Against Women Act is once again up for debate and a vote in the Senate. The previous iteration of the bill failed last year, having stalled in the Senate after complaints concerning the bill’s handgun restrictions, carve-outs for LGBTQ groups, stealth “gender identity” inclusions, and the constitutionally prohibited expansion of the jurisdiction of Indian tribal courts. That’s why its sponsors went back to the drawing board. Unfortunately, what they “redrew” isn’t good enough. While the 2022 version is being hailed as a compromise, it is anything but. The primary difference? The reader must wade through 100 more pages—335 in total—than the 2021 version, and carefully read between the lines to see which problematic provisions have been moved where. Much of the language has been changed to hide the most noxious provisions. But the effects are precisely the same. Here are the Violence Against Women Act’s biggest flaws: 1. Gender Identity Because “gender identity” is a favorite leftist dog whistle, it appears in the current version of this bill. The stealth inclusion of “gender identity” under sex-specific provisions, particularly as concerns single-sex spaces like federal prisons and shelters for battered women, is nothing but a political power play. In the very spaces where women need protection the most, they would be forced to share intimate spaces with men who identify as women if this bill is enacted. This does nothing to protect the safety of women who bear the disproportionate brunt of domestic abuse and sexual assault statistics in this country. The current bill text also makes no provision for a religious exemption that might be exercised by faith-based homeless or battered women’s shelters who refuse to sacrifice their faith on the altar of “gender identity.” This would naturally exclude them from participation in Violence Against Women Act grant programs if, for example, their arrangements maintain designated spaces for men and women. Since the Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized and signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2013, gender identity protections have appeared alongside traditional sex-based distinctions. This should be the year those classifications end. 2. Equity Over Equality The 2022 Violence Against Women Act’s new buzzword is “culturally specific communities”—code for special-interest groups. The term appears in tandem with companion statements on “improving equity and reducing disparities,” perpetuating another favorite left-wing narrative that while the Constitution guarantees the “equal protection of the laws,” what matters instead is “equity,” or, giving one individual enough of a resource to ensure everyone ends up in the same place. As to what criteria are used to establish that one party is disadvantaged, or what standards or remedies must be applied to ensure equity is accomplished, no one can say. The Senate can choose which party is disadvantaged, the result it wants, and how much money it wants to spend to get there. And in this case, that amount is jaw-dropping. The unfortunate reality is that the government would be left to its own devices in determining what “equity” would look like. Knowing that this administration previously permitted the use of racial classifications in the distribution of COVID-19 relief in the interests of equity, for example, it has often looked like a violation of civil rights law. 3. Price Tag The previous Violence Against Women Act was funded to the tune of $578 million. But the current bill proposes a whopping $750 million for a host of programs, many of them driven by and toward special interests. This represents a stunning 30% increase from previous funding at a time when inflation and the national debt are at an all-time high. This also presupposes that the previous Violence Against Women Act funding has run out, which it most certainly has not. In fact, the Office on Violence Against Women recently granted $1.2 million to the New York City Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, pulling from funding it received in 2018. Among the more head-scratching increases, the director of the Office of Violence Against Woman gets an $80,000 raise, something that makes little sense in light of the rising rates of domestic violence during the pandemic. What justifies such a significant raise? In addition, Section 206 of the bill creates a new grant program specifically for LGBT groups for a total of $40 million over five years. The preoccupation with cramming identity-driven protections into federal law does a disservice to the name “Violence Against Women Act.” Every resource and funded program available through the Violence Against Women Act should be available to women in the aggregate, regardless of their sexual orientation. The Senate hasn’t justified carve-outs for “underserved populations,” and to include, for example, nonbinary individuals or homosexual men alongside women in the bill makes a mockery of hard-won efforts to achieve equality. 4. Constitutional Conundrum Then, there is the not-insignificant matter of the act’s constitutionally prohibited expansion of tribal jurisdiction in violation of Articles II and III of the U.S. Constitution (with a cost of $155 million to accompany it). By permitting the courts of Indian tribal nations—legally recognized as sovereign nations, not states—to exercise jurisdiction over non-Indians charged with certain criminal offenses on tribal lands, the Violence Against Women Act gives those tribal courts jurisdiction that they simply do not have. Two realities make this provision a problem: First, Article II of the Constitution makes clear that only duly appointed officers of the United States have the power to criminally convict and imprison American citizens as an exercise of the government’s power. Because tribal judges as citizens of sovereign nations cannot ever be appointed, they lack the authority to criminally convict non-Indians—no matter what the Senate bill says. Second, Article III of the Constitution also clarifies the conditions under which Congress appoints federal judges, including life tenure during good behavior and salary protection. Here’s the problem: Congress has not and cannot give tribal court judges life tenure, nor has it protected their salaries from being decreased. As a strict constitutional matter, the “special tribal jurisdiction” that the Violence Against Women Act tries to establish would—if challenged in court—most likely fail on its face. 5. Abortion Protection By way of an impressive sleight of hand, the latest version of the bill seeks to establish a prevention and education program related to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. The bill also addresses “technological abuse and reproductive and sexual coercion, that is age-appropriate, culturally relevant, ongoing, delivered in multiple venues on campus, accessible, promotes respectful nonviolent behavior as a social norm, and engages men and boys.” Did you catch that? “Reproductive coercion” is a back door approach to making sure that young men who impregnant their girlfriends, or even young married men who impregnant their wives, have essentially relinquished their say in whether the woman should have an abortion. To refuse to terminate the life of the unborn child amounts to “reproductive coercion” and, for purposes of the Violence Against Women Act, domestic violence. In the Senate’s mind, to prevent an abortion is violence, but to have an abortion is tranquility. Same Story, Different Day In short, the 2022 Violence Against Women Act reauthorization is same story, different day. And it does nothing to protect the interests of biological women, equality, the unborn, or the rule of law. It does, however, play politics with the lives of women who need it most.

{"title": "Paying Lip Service to Liberty While Imposing Radical Gender Ideology", "author": ["Jared  Eckert", "Makenna  McCoy"], "date": "Jul 9, 2021 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/paying-lip-service-liberty-while-imposing-radical-gender-ideology", "takeaways": ["These types of policies impose radical gender ideology as orthodoxy by compelling speech and eliminating dissent.", "These policies make students suffer in other ways by turning single-sex sports and spaces, such as restrooms and locker rooms, into co-ed environments.", " Even where female students are protected from unfair competition and the invasion of privacy, speech still may be compelled by local school policies."], "text": "Schools should be places where students enjoy free speech to express and hear different ideas in pursuit of truth. But in Virginia’s Loudoun County and other school districts across the country, school boards are shutting down debate before it even happens by requiring affirmation of an individual’s self-asserted gender identity. “I support differing opinions and spirited debates,” Loudoun County School Board Chairwoman Brenda Sheridan said in closing a contentious public hearing over two proposed gender identity policies. But contrary to Sheridan’s statement, these types of policies impose radical gender ideology as orthodoxy by compelling speech and eliminating dissent. One proposal states that at the request of a student, school staff must use the name and pronoun corresponding to a student’s self-asserted gender identity. Staff and students “who intentionally or persistently refuse” to use that name or pronouns would be in violation of the policy. Although the policy does not state consequences for such violations, recent events in Loudoun County’s public school system offer a preview. In May, elementary gym teacher Byron “Tanner” Cross expressed his dissent at a school board meeting and subsequently was suspended.\n\nDuring a “public comment” time, Cross, who is a Christian, said: “I’m a teacher, but I serve God first. And I will not affirm that a biological boy can be a girl and vice versa because it is against my religion. It’s lying to a child. It’s abuse to a child.” Cross took the school board to court, where a judge ruled that his  constitutional rights likely were violated and ordered the school system to reinstate him while the lawsuit continues. But it’s not just the religious who will be persecuted by gender identity policies in schools. Anyone who believes in the indisputable science of the sexual binary will be subject to penalty under such policies. This is contrary to the purpose of education. Policies that restrict speech and inquiry and impose a single viewpoint on students stifle their intellectual inquiry rather than encourage it. In addition to squelching students’ curiosity, these policies make students suffer in other ways by turning single-sex sports and spaces, such as restrooms and locker rooms, into co-ed environments. These policies require a student only to assert an internal sense of gender identity to gain access to a single-sex facility. This deprives students, especially girls, of privacy and safety. In Georgia, a 5-year-old girl was sexually assaulted by a boy who identified as gender-fluid and was allowed into the girls’ restroom. With all the outrage over sexual and domestic abuse in recent years, we should be creating policies that make girls less vulnerable, not creating more risks. Allowing males who identify as girls to compete in girls sports eliminates fairness, equality, and opportunity. Currently, about 300 U.S. high school boys can beat Allyson Felix’s personal best in the 400-meter sprint, although she is the most decorated athlete in World Athletics Championships history and a six-time Olympic gold medalist. Even if those biological males were taking cross-sex hormones, two years on estrogen does not erase their competitive advantage. Letting biological males compete in women’s sports forces girls to forfeit scholarships and opportunity designated for them under the federal law known as Title IX. A national movement is coalescing around the Promise to America’s Children, which outlines 10 principles for protecting children’s minds, bodies, and relationships with their parents. Included are freedom of speech and freedom of conscience in the classroom, as well as fairness in girls sports. Numerous state lawmakers are working on legislation to protect students and school staff from harmful gender policies of woke school boards such as the one in Loudoun County, Virginia. Eight states have passed legislation to protect women’s sports. Similar bills have been introduced in another 23 states, where they face stiff opposition. Governors such as Kristi Noem in South Dakota and Bel Edwards in Louisiana in effect have opposed bills banning biological males from competing in women’s sports. When Ohio state Rep. Jena Powell proposed an amendment to protect women’s sports, chaos ensued on the House floor as Democrats yelled and pounded their desks. Defending women’s sports is only part of the solution. Even where female students are protected from unfair competition and the invasion of privacy, speech still may be compelled by local school policies. At least five states have introduced legislation to protect teachers and students from curriculum that includes divisive critical race theory. States should consider similar policies prohibiting the requirement of any curriculum or school policy that treats radical gender ideology as orthodoxy. For elected leaders such as Brenda Sheridan in Loudoun County, supporting woke policies that impose gender ideology as orthodoxy renders vocal support for “differing opinions” no more than lip service. We need leaders who will stand up for free speech in public schools. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal."},

Many now see two great nations with robust liberal traditions surrendering to a secular woke orthodoxy that threatens to demolish the pillars of free speech and freedom of religion on which the two nations stand. But we suggest that there is something seriously wrong with this viewpoint: the idea that woke ideology is secular. On the contrary, while many commentators have noted the quasi-religious fervor of social justice warriors, complete with foundational “sacred” texts, go-to advocates (or rather, high priests), taboos and heresy trials, we propose that the time has come to treat woke ideology as being a belief system that places paramount ethical value on identity markers—race, sexual orientation and “gender identity.” It operates as a religion, not least in the legal sense. If their belief system is successfully enshrined at the societal level—and the winds certainly appear to favor them—it will mean the woke would have to compete on an equal basis with all other faiths, rather than claiming that their beliefs are incontrovertible facts which everyone must honor. Religion is notoriously difficult to define. It need not involve belief in a deity; Buddha, for example, was not a god, just an extraordinary man, according to his followers. But the woke belief that gender identity, not biology, defines the “real” person, certainly has the look of a metaphysical soul. >>> Don’t Be Fooled: Gender Identity Policies Don’t Follow the Science In the United States, courts first recognized secular-progressivism as a religion in World War II conscientious objector cases. During the Vietnam War, the Supreme Court found that instead of “belief in a Supreme Being,” a conscientious objector to armed conflict need only demonstrate a “belief that is sincere and meaningful [and] occupies a place in the life of its possessor parallel to that filled by [traditional religion]” to satisfy the relevant statute. Today, wokeism occupies a place in the life of its followers parallel to that of the most devout Christian, Jew or Muslim. But wokeism seeks to dominate the lives of all citizens in a manner that Christianity, Judaism or Islam never could because the establishment clause of the U.S. Constitution forbids it. Yet, zealous adherents of wokeism seek to establish their ideology as state-sponsored orthodoxy via protected categories in state and federal non-discrimination laws which include gender self-identification. We agree with former U.S. Attorney General William Barr that it is time to examine whether wokeism in public institutions is unconstitutional, because it operates as a state-sponsored religion. This is happening on both sides of the Atlantic. The high priests of wokeism have weaponized laws to punish teachers, professors and doctors who would not utter support for the idea of human sex change, something that is biologically, and, some would say, metaphysically, impossible. Those who dare to question tenets of wokeism like “a transwoman is a woman” or who fail to use “preferred pronouns” are treated as modern-day heretics who deserve to be canceled on social media, fired from their jobs and even investigated by the police. This is what I (Bernard) found out the hard way. When the woke came to my secondary school, I gave that fateful sermon to students telling them that while it’s OK to try and persuade each other, no one should be told they must accept an ideology—either wokeism or Christianity. I told them to “Love the person, even where you profoundly dislike the ideas.” I suggested they may (but need not) accept traditional beliefs about marriage and the reality of sex differences. I told them that if the idea of gender identity is, as it appears, incoherent, it can only be partly true. This led to me being fired for gross misconduct, as well as being reported to the police as a terrorism threat, and to child welfare services as a potential abuser. In the U.K. there is no constitutional protection that prevents the government from establishing an official religion. This makes the danger from wokeism greater in some senses. >>> Equality Act Would Cancel Religious Freedom But there is cause for hope. U.K. law makes no distinction between religion and philosophical beliefs which impact behavior. The recent judgment in the case of researcher Maya Forstater found her beliefs in biological sex are protected in law. The corollary is that gender identity beliefs have equal, but not greater status than religious ones. When opinion can become dogma from which no whisper of dissent is permitted, free societies are in danger. We can already begin to see self-censorship among the young who encounter wokeism at earlier and earlier ages. With both public and private schools adopting the tenets of woke gender ideology in curriculum and policies parents, teachers and pupils have few places to turn. The answer is neither to bend the knee nor to seek escape. Now is the time to shore up the foundations of freedom of speech and religion while we can, before wokeism smashes them and the pluralistic societies which rest upon them into bits. We believe the law of both lands still provide the resources our pluralistic societies need."},

But giving more power to social-media platforms is two steps in the opposite direction."], "text": "Since whistle blower Francis Haugen leaked documents revealing how Instagram harms teenage girls, lawmakers have scrambled to respond. Recently, Senators Marsha Blackburn (R., Tenn.) and Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) introduced the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA). Among the bill’s various features, KOSA aims to protect online users, ages 16 and younger, in two key ways: first, by giving platforms the power to prevent and mitigate potentially harmful content, and second, by forcing platforms to create accessible, user-friendly safeguards and parental controls. In particular, it aims to address “physical, emotional, developmental, or material” threats that social mediapose to minors. This includes content that promotes self-harm and eating disorders, online bullying, harassment, sexual exploitation, the marketing of products that are illegal for minors, and more. These are real problems. But as scholars Clare Morrell and Patrick Brown of the Ethics and Public Policy Center have noted, the devil is in the details. In this case, he’s hiding in the bill’s broad language and cheering the new powers it would grant to Big Tech platforms. >>> The White House Plan to Make Gender Ideology a Central Theme of the American Experiment Gender Ideology Gets a Pass For example, the bill’s list of online harms has a glaring omission: gender ideology. It spreads on social media like the Omicron variant but is far more dangerous for kids and teens. Take the case of Keira Bell, the young woman who sued the United Kingdom’s National Health Service for fast-tracking her and other teens’ “gender transitions.” As a minor, Keira was put on puberty blockers and received cross-sex hormone therapy. At age 22, after having her breasts surgically removed, Keira found that her “transition” had failed to resolve her psychological distress about her womanhood. It also left her body irreversibly damaged. Guess where Bell discovered the notion of “transgender identity” and “gender transition”? Not in the classroom or a counseling office, but on the Internet. Recent research suggests that this holds for most kids who transition. According to one study, transitioners most often reported YouTube videos (48 percent) and Tumblr (45 percent) as sources of encouragement in starting the process. Another studyfound that 65 percent of those who have transitioned were spirited along by online groups, forums, and social media. With social-media and smartphone usage skewing younger and younger, the threat of falling prey to “gender-affirming” propaganda is greater than ever. As of 2019, 41 percent of all eight- to twelve-year-old Americans owned smartphones. Almost 70 percent owned a smartphone by age 12. Eighty-two percent of those ages 13 to 17—and 31 percent of those between eight and twelve—had used social media at some point. Social-media platforms are known spreaders of social contagion that can do real harm to kids’ minds and, ultimately, their bodies. Any bill aimed at protecting kids online should do something to slow its spread. Yet KOSA ignores this problem altogether. Empowering Platforms, Not Parents Another major flaw in the bill is that it ignores the fact that social-media platforms profit from promoting these ideas. Given that reality, it’s doubtful that they can be expected to judge impartially what content does and does not harm kids. The bill rightfully places the onus on social-media platforms to create user-friendly safeguards and parental controls. It’s wrong, however, to deputize platforms as content police—especially when vague language would allow them to censor content based on their woke preferences. As written, KOSA requires platforms to prevent and mitigate online “harassment,” “bullying,” and the promotion of “other matters that pose a risk to physical and mental health of a minor.” Yet nowhere are these terms defined. This is a huge problem. Such vague terms allow platforms to go beyond just blocking content illegal to minors. Without clear definitions, there’s nothing to stop a platform from banning or boosting content in the name of “mental health” or “anti-bullying efforts.” >>> Florida’s Parental Rights in Education Bill Hits Target: Gender Ideology Harms Kids Again, just think how this might go when it comes to gender ideology. Groups such as the American Psychiatric Association claim that helping kids socially and medically transition is crucial for “mental health.” And allied gender activists denounce as “conversion therapy” efforts to help teens become comfortable with their sexed bodies (which we know happens for most teens—as long as they’re not put on the fast track to “transition”). Given their ideological sympathies, however, many Big Tech companies could boost the gender-activist line and suppress alternatives grounded in sound science. Indeed, they could, and likely would, promote gender transition despite the damage it does to teens. User-friendly safeguards and controls may be one step in the right direction. But giving more power to social-media platforms is two steps in the opposite direction. Good intentions aren’t enough. Kids and their parents need legislation that can serve as more than a bipartisan talking point. If lawmakers really want to protect kids from online harms, they should pursue policies that empower parents and hold Big Tech more accountable."},

But that advance hit a high hurdle last week in Texas. A federal district court judge blocked an Obama-era measure that forced medical professionals to participate in gender transition surgery and similar measures, even against their medical or moral judgment. This “transgender mandate” saga began in 2016. That’s when the Office for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services manipulated the definition of “sex” to include sexual orientation and gender identity under Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. The mandate coercing medical professionals to toe the line on this expanded definition of “sex” provided no exemption for religious conscience or professional opinion based on medical training and experience. As a result, it also trumped the conscience rights of doctors and hospitals who still recognize that the biological differences between males and females can’t be bridged with pill and scalpel. In 2020, the Trump administration reversed course, but the Biden administration promptly revived the Obamacare rule. Fortunately, District Judge Reed O’Connor, a 2007 appointee of President George W. Bush, issued a permanent injunction Aug. 9 against the mandate. The lynchpin of the victory was O’Connor’s reliance on the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which he said was violated by the transgender mandate. Ruling Based in Law The mandate forced a Catholic hospital association “to perform and provide insurance coverage for gender-transition procedures” or face fines and civil liability, O’Connor wrote in his decision. The Religious Freedom Restoration Act, passed with the opposition of only three senators and signed into law in 1993 by President Bill Clinton, ensures protection of the rights of conscience against an overreaching federal law or policy that impinges on someone’s religious beliefs or practices, requiring the federal government to satisfy a “strict scrutiny” standard. This means that the federal government may interfere with the exercise of someone’s religion only if it can establish that such interference is the least restrictive means available to achieve a compelling purpose. O’Connor’s ruling in Texas is a key victory for doctors, other health care providers, and their supporters and defenders. As a result, medical workers may continue to follow their moral, religious, and professional convictions in treating patients when gender issues are involved. Right to Conscience Policy should concern itself with the well-being of patients and providers. And a basic moral principle is at stake for health care providers: their central duty to do no harm. Our society long has recognized that medical care involves two parties—the patient and the doctor. Patients should be free to seek treatment, and doctors should be free to exercise their judgment about the right treatment for patients. The transgender mandate violates this principle. Using it, the state may force doctors to offer treatment they oppose. Many doctors, for instance, reasonably believe that to remove healthy organs, or to give young people puberty-blocking drugs, would harm their patients—whatever the subjective wishes of the patient. Healthy organs are not deadly tumors, and puberty is not a disease. O’Connor’s ruling protects such medical judgment, whether it’s based on scientific evidence, religious conviction, or plain common sense. Equality Act Looms Large The judge’s permanent injunction against Obamacare’s transgender mandate is a victory in the ongoing effort to protect the conscience rights of medical professionals and the freedom to recognize the reality of biological sex, whether in the home or the hospital. The largest looming challenge to such freedom is the Equality Act (HR 5), currently before Congress. This proposed law, like Obamacare’s transgender mandate, would expand the definition of sex discrimination to cover sexual orientation and gender identity. It would force all those who still affirm the reality of biological sex to submit to radical gender ideology no matter their professional, religious, or moral judgment. How so? The proposed law would punish speech and action based on reasonable, long-held, and widespread views about marriage, sex differences, and many other sincerely held beliefs. It would politicize not just medicine but education and even family life. That’s because the Equality Act explicitly states that the Religious Freedom Restoration Actis not available as a potential defense for any conflicts that might arise. But RFRA is the very statute that O’Connor recognized days ago to protect the conscience of medical professionals from Obamacare’s transgender mandate. The court victory in Texas is real, and it is most welcome. But society must do much more work to defend conscience rights for medical providers and protect the freedom of parents, teachers, and others to affirm biological reality wherever radical gender ideology threatens to curtail it. That mad dash through our laws and institutions? It’s just getting started. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},
{"title": "Feminism: An Elite Ideology", "author": ["Brenda  Hafera"], "date": "Oct 20, 2021 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/feminism-elite-ideology", "takeaways": ["American feminism one time was based on democratic principles. First-wave feminists fought for equality before the law, property rights, and the vote.", "First-wave feminists sought to align themselves with the classical liberal tradition, second-wave feminists were trustees of imported French and German Marxism.", "The sexual revolutionist arguments of Millett and others have harmed women, men, and families, particularly those in the working class."], "text": "In recent years, there’s been a lot of talk about elitism. Elites dominate higher education, Hollywood, Big Tech, and the media. They are the champions of critical race theory and identity politics, branches of the same poisonous Marxist tree. Such ideologies are based on group rather than individual rights and divide the world into oppressors and oppressed. But one of these ideologies has managed to cloak itself in a populist disguise: feminism. American feminism at one time was a belief system based on democratic principles. First-wave feminists fought for equality before the law, property rights, and the vote. But second-wave feminist intellectual elites would hijack the term and the movement. Second-wave feminism included two main components: employment reform and the sexual revolution. Some feminists cared about one over the other while others believed the two could not be divorced. But what did the women of middle America believe? Betty Friedan is often credited with launching second-wave feminism in America with the publication of her book, “The Feminine Mystique.” She encouraged women to fulfill their purpose by entering the workforce. Her account of the lonely and bored 1950s and ’60s housewife was a national bestseller and sold over a million copies. In truth, its influence is unquantifiable, as her arguments (some of which were valid) transformed the workplace and seeped into the American consciousness. >>> The Erasure of “Women” Is Escalating As more feminists joined the movement Friedan launched, feminism became institutionalized. Friedan herself helped found the National Organization for Women in 1966. But tensions within the feminist movement soon arose in part because of arguments Kate Millett put forth in her radical book, “Sexual Politics.” Millett called for the destruction of the family and the sexualizing of children and taught that differences between men and women were a result of convention rather than nature. Those who adhered to her ideology also contended that women were oppressed merely by being heterosexual. Feminists like Friedan lamented this shift: “The women’s movement was not about sex, but about equal opportunity. . . . It should not be the main issue, the tail that wags the dog.” It was certainly not the focus of “The Feminine Mystique” that had appealed to so many women. Millett attempted to position herself as the successor to first-wave feminists, claiming they began the “sexual revolution.” Portraying herself as continuing a popular movement was a good rhetorical strategy, as it made her arguments seem less radical: “Nothing to see here, folks. I am just furthering the work of American women of the past.” Such an allegiance would have probably come as a shock to early feminists Lucretia Mott and Susan B. Anthony, both of whom were Quakers. Though she appropriated the term (and their authority), Millett’s sexual politics is more properly understood as a break from, rather than a continuation of, first-wave feminism. First-wave feminists sought to align themselves with the classical liberal tradition, while second-wave feminists of Millett’s ilk were trustees of imported French and German Marxism. When determining what about feminism resonated with American women, we would do better to look to Friedan over other second-wave feminists. In 1971, almost 65 percent of women had never heard of Gloria Steinem, Germaine Greer, or Kate Millett. The majority of American women in the 1970s “favored efforts to improve women’s status” but became unsympathetic to women’s liberation groups. They did not want to renounce their femininity or deny differences between men and women. It seems most American women were more interested in the feminism that promoted opportunities for women rather than sexual politics. Despite radical sexual revolutionists’ disagreements with the principles of first-wave American feminists as well as average women of their own era, elite second-wave feminists became the gatekeepers of the feminist machine. Modern feminism is more the legacy of feminist intellectuals like Millett than the more popular Friedan. As second-wave feminism continued and morphed into third-wave feminism, it gained power and prominence by aligning itself with advocates of identity politics. Today, arguments of feminists and identitarians are often indistinguishable. They view history as a struggle between oppressed women and patriarchal men and want retributive justice to make up for past wrongs. Most American women today somewhat sympathize with feminism, but 39 percent also view it as polarizing. Does feminism deserve women’s loyalty, or has it become an elite ideology characterized by separatism and moral superiority? In truth, the sexual revolutionist arguments of Millett and others have harmed women, men, and families, particularly those in the working class. >>> Economic Freedom Best Path to Women’s Equality, Empowerment The affluent (including sexual revolutionists) attacked monogamy and the nuclear family in the 1960s. Those in the working class are now far less likely to get married and 10 times more likely to have children out of wedlock. Yet “young adults are at least ten percentage points less likely to be poor at age 25 if they were born to married parents.” The success sequence – getting a high-school degree, working, marrying, then having children, in that order – continues to be the ticket to financial flourishing. Elites still follow this sequence themselves but publicly dismiss its importance. Although first-wave feminism helped rectify legal injustices, the victory of elite sexual revolutionists over other branches of feminism has harmed Middle America. American women can be grateful for the legal advances of the past without needing to extend their loyalty to feminism today. While first-wave feminists fought for the representation of all American women, modern feminism no longer represents us."},

And no amount of cross-sex hormones can undo the biological benefits of male genetics and development.", "Polling shows that 67% of Americans oppose allowing biological males who identify as transgender to compete in girls and women’s athletics.", "As we prepare to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Title IX next year, elected officials should stand up for women, for reality, and for the American public."], "text": "A transgender athlete, Lia Thomas, dominated during a Nov. 20 women’s swim meet with athletes representing Cornell, Princeton, and the University of Pennsylvania. Thomas, a biological male who identifies as a woman, set new Ivy League records for the women’s 500 and 200 freestyle and smashed numerous UPenn records in women’s swimming. In the 1650 freestyle final, Thomas, who used to swim on UPenn’s men’s team as Will Thomas, blew the competition out of the water—finishing first with a devastating, 38-second lead. Sadly, stories such as this one have become more common. If the Biden-Harris administration has its way, they could become the rule. Just a few weeks after Thomas trounced biologically female teammates, President Joe Biden’s Department of Education announced plans to amend Title IX regulations to conform to the president’s executive order on what it calls “Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation.” Such amendments by the Education Department would allow biological males to compete against women in the name of “equality” and “preventing discrimination.” But the truth is, these amendments would contradict reality, equality, and popular opinion. Hormone levels alone don’t make someone a woman. And no amount of cross-sex hormones can undo the biological benefits of male genetics and development. A 2020 study by the BMJ, formerly the British Journal of Medicine, shows that male athletes who are “transitioning” retain a competitive edge against women even after two years of taking estrogen. In earlier days, one wouldn’t have needed a scientific study to prove the point. Thomas’ 38-second lead in the freestyle speaks for itself. And yet, gender ideologues continue to deny reality. Despite the science, the NCAA—and the International Olympics Committee—requires that a biological male’s testosterone must be suppressed for only one year before that male is free to compete against women. Like the NCAA, the Biden administration’s latest announcement denies the science of biological sex. However, denying the truth has consequences. Specifically, the denial of sexual reality robs women of the very opportunities protected by the federal law known as Title IX. Under Title IX, women’s athletics received equal resources for facilities, training, recruitment, and scholarships. As a result, far more womenparticipated in sports. In 1972, the number of female athletes in high school totaled 295,000. Now there are 2.6 million. The number of female college athletes has quintupled in that same time. Title IX also is credited with decreasing dropout rates for women and increasing the number of women in higher education. Allowing trans-identifying biological males to compete in women’s sports, or for women’s scholarships, reverses this progress. Thomas’ drubbing of female swimmers in the Ivy League is just the latest example. The female athlete who would have placed first ended up placing second—to Thomas, a biological male with a proven biological advantage. What’s more, Thomas’ personal bests in the 500 and 1650 freestyle would break current NCAA records in women’s swimming set by an Olympic gold medalist, Katie Ledecky. Imagine if Thomas had competed against Ledecky and performed at a personal-best level. The world might never have come to know of Ledecky. Now imagine how many women athletes would miss out on scholarship and career opportunities if forced to compete against biological males in every contest. This is the world the White House seeks to usher in. Being out of step with reality is bad enough. But the Biden administration is out of step with Americans, too. Polling shows that 67% of Americans oppose allowing biological males who identify as transgender to compete in girls and women’s athletics. Twenty states are suing the Department of Education over the new regulations. Over 37 states have introduced bills to keep women’s sports for women. Nine have passed such bills. The Biden administration and its gender-activist allies made their unpopular view clear from Day One. The administration won’t be content to stop at changing Title IX regulations. It will go on to rewrite the law to force female athletes across the nation to compete against biological males. Barring that, the White House will seek to change the law piece by piece. It will be the death of women’s sports by a thousand cuts. Enough is enough. As we prepare to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Title IX next year, elected officials should stand up for women, for reality, and for the American public.

Commission on Status of Women, Far Left Ties Gender Ideology, Abortion to Climate Change", "author": ["Grace  Melton"], "date": "Mar 31, 2022 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/life/commentary/un-commission-status-women-far-left-ties-gender-ideology-abortion-climate-change", "takeaways": ["Whatever its stated theme, radical feminists and their allies use this annual event as cover for radical policies and abortion on demand.", "The program of official side events also reveals how radical the discourse and demands are at the Commission on the Status of Women.", "It’s hard to believe that the United Nations is serious about improving women’s lives when it seems to promote abortion at every turn."], "text": "The United Nations’ annual Commission on the Status of Women concluded last week in New York. Delegates and activists from around the world met to discuss climate change, the environment, and reducing the risk of disaster with “gender equality at the [center] of solutions.” In other words, it was business as usual. Whatever its stated theme, radical feminists and their allies in Western governments and the U.N. bureaucracy use the annual event as cover for radical policies and abortion on demand. This year, they folded their abortion promotion into left-wing gender ideology and yoked it with the well-funded climate agenda. The U.S. delegation to the Commission on the Status of Women included radical partisans of the Biden administration. Jennifer Klein, director of the White House Gender Policy Council, was one. She led the White House effort to infuse gender ideology throughout American policy. Another U.S. delegate was teenage “climate justice activist” Alexandria Villasenor. The White House used the occasion of the Commission on the Status of Women to highlight its gender equity and equality strategy and to tout its support for the deeply flawed Violence Against Women Act at home. Tying left-wing policies on abortion and gender to the environment is nothing new. Nor is it altruistic. The U.N. has marked $100 billion in annual funds to combat climate change. That might sound nice, but it creates a giant incentive to frame the gender agenda and abortion as “climate justice.” The U.N. LGBTI Core Group—of which the United States is a member—has done just that. Its statement to the commission claims it “is crucial to address the critical links between gender equality, human rights, climate change and environmental issues, and the impacts on LGBTI persons.” It’s the same story in the report of the U.N. secretary-general. The report argues that “[c]limate and environmental crises and disasters can curtail the sexual and reproductive health and rights of women and girls.” What’s more, it claims that “gender discrimination compounds the risks for young women and adolescent girls and gender-diverse persons.” How does the secretary-general support such claims? With reports from the International Planned Parenthood Federation and Women Deliver, two of the most prominent abortion advocates in the world. Just ahead of the opening of the Commission on the Status of Women, the World Health Organization issued its new guidance on abortion. It calls for the “full decriminalization” of abortion; that abortion be available upon the “request of the woman, girl or other pregnant person”; and the use of telemedicine to “deliver medical abortion services in whole or in part.” It even goes so far as to call for “conscientious objection” to abortion on the part of doctors and other providers to “become indefensible.” Many speakers at the Commission on the Status of Women promoted what the pro-abortion Center for Reproductive Rights praised as the WHO’s “most progressive guidance to date.” Sadly, international abortion advocates have a committed ally in the Biden White House. The commission’s events and resulting document show just how much political and diplomatic weight American support brings to their radical goals. The program of official side events also reveals how radical the discourse and demands are at the Commission on the Status of Women. Most of these events hit on at least two, if not all three, priorities of gender ideology, abortion, and climate change. A few examples: It’s hard to believe that the United Nations is serious about improving women’s lives when it seems to promote abortion at every turn. Furthermore, its embrace of gender ideology threatens to erase women by denying the realities of biological sex. This is not just a concern of conservatives. A growing number of brave feminists fear that gender ideology will pulverize the rights of women they have fought to defend. In fact, abortion and gender ideology undermine fundamental human rights. To improve the lives of women and girls, U.N. entities—and all member state governments—should advance pro-woman policies. That means promoting human dignity and preserving unalienable human rights for everyone. The push for abortion and gender policy does not just depart from those rights; it undercuts them.

Department of Health and Human Services proposed a rule that would add sexual orientation and gender identity language to the 2010 Affordable Care Act. According to the department, these amendments will ensure that those who identify as LGBT receive “medically necessary” care. This includes “gender-affirming” surgeries and hormone “therapy.” In fact, the department’s proposed rule circumvents the law and treats dubious treatments as essential health benefits in qualified health plans. This not only contradicts the best science and medicine, it’s a disaster for insurers, for medical providers, and, most of all, for those struggling with gender dysphoria. Sex, Gender, and Discrimination The rule has legal problems, but we shouldn’t allow that to distract us from the fact that it strikes at the heart of what it means to be human. To see this, it helps to keep a few definitions in mind. First is “sex.” Human beings are a sexually dimorphic species. With the very rare exceptions (such as those resulting from disorders of sexual development, sometimes called “intersex”), everyone is clearly either male or female. This is biology. It’s also common sense—as revealed by the testimony of every culture in every time and place throughout history. Many people also affirm the sexual binary of male and female on religious grounds. The book of Genesis, for instance, says that God created us “male and female.” The next term is “gender,” which is best seen as the social and psychological correlate to sex—as sexologist Debra Soh has argued. “Male” and “female” connote sex. “Masculine” and “feminine” connote gender. Then there’s “gender identity,” which comes from the lexicon of gender ideology. According to one popular definition, gender identity “refers to a person’s understanding and experience of their own gender.” Note the circularity. Once untethered from biological sex, gender identity can mean almost anything. Hence the current taxonomy of 72 genders—subject, of course, to expansion. This subtle shift in terms is critical. Behind “gender-affirming care” is the hope of aligning the recipient’s body with his or her gender identity. Such “care,” however, is at best cosmetic. It cannot achieve the impossible: to change someone’s sex with chemicals or scalpels. The Department of Health and Human Services rule would, in effect, erase a key aspect of our humanity. That is, it would displace biological sex as a criterion for medical care with a fluid and illusory notion of gender identity. This, in turn, would also serve as precedent for further policy changes elsewhere in the administrative state. Conscience and the Reality of Sex Despite the infiltration of gender ideology in government bureaucracies, many people still know—on rational, scientific, medical, and/or religious grounds—that sex is immutable. Doctors and government officials, they believe, should recognize sex as a human reality, not treat it like a fashion choice, or, still less, like a tumor that can be surgically removed. Many insurers, medical professionals, and health insurance enrollees hold such views. And they will want nothing to do with chemical and surgical interventions for the purpose of “gender transition.” The new HHS rule, if approved, would force many medical professionals to violate their medical expertise and religious convictions. While advocates of the rule claim it will comply with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993—which severely restricts government interference with religious belief—the rule deems treatments that exclude gender-affirming interventions as “presumptively discriminatory.” But this is bound to conflict with the religious and medical consciences of many people—and, thus, to run afoul of the law. In any case, views based on reasonable medical, moral, and religious beliefs and the best interests of the patient are nothing like invidious discrimination. The federal government should not treat them as such. Neither Medically Necessary nor Helpful But what if, as the proposed rule claims, “clinical evidence supports medically necessary gender affirming care” and shows that such coverage “can significantly improve the health and well-being” of patients? Proponents claim that gender-affirming care is medically necessary because the presumed alternative to hormones or surgeries is suicide. Thus, the express goal of this so-called care is to improve mental health, and so prevent suicide. Despite activists’ claims, the clinical evidence shows otherwise. A 2019 study of the largest dataset of patients who have undergone gender-affirming surgeries “demonstrated no advantage of surgery in relation to subsequent mood or anxiety disorder-related health care.” It likewise found no benefits to chemical interventions, such as cross-sex hormones. The most thorough follow-up study is far more troubling. It reports that those who have undergone gender-affirming surgeries are, after 10 to 15 years, 20 times more likely to commit suicide than are comparable peers. There are also serious risks for those who receive drugs and surgery for the purpose of gender transition. Puberty blockers lead to decreased bone density and prevent the proper “sex-steroid dependent organization and maturation of the adolescent brain.” Those who use cross-sex hormones have a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, depression, and permanent sterilization, among other things. “Sex-reassignment” surgeries carry even more serious risks that lead to long-term complications and worse mental health. Misreading Bostock Despite all these problems with this HHS rule, does the Supreme Court’s 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County require it? The Department of Health and Human Services seems to think so. It bases the proposed rule on two other directives. The first, “Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation,” is an executive order that Biden issued on the first day he took office. The second is the department’s May 10, 2021, notification of enforcement of the same. In both documents, the administration cites the Supreme Court’s ruling as grounds for expanding the meaning of sex discrimination to include sexual orientation and gender identity. This, however, is a distortion of the court’s reasoning. According to Justice Neil Gorsuch, the court proceeded “on the assumption that ‘sex’ signified what the employers suggest, referring only to biological distinctions between male and female.” Gorsuch underscored the narrowness of the ruling by stating that the ruling applied only to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which deals only with matters of employment. He thus anticipated and rebuffed future efforts to apply Bostock to all civil rights regulations. What’s more, the court stressed that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act serves as a “super statute.” As a result, in many contexts, the act protects actions that might otherwise run afoul of a nondiscrimination rule. In appropriate cases, Gorsuch noted, the act could apply even in employment. Once again, Gorsuch sought to preempt flawed readings of the court’s ruling in Bostock. The new rule relies on just such a flawed reading. It lacks legal basis to amend the proposed nondiscrimination provisions and contradicts the plain meaning of laws against sex discrimination. Costly Harm From its flawed interpretation of Bostock to its faulty medical evidence, this new rule is clearly the result of gender ideology, not solid science and sound reason. If approved, the rule would further undermine evidence-based medical research and health care involving gender dysphoria. It would force insurers, medical providers, and those enrolled in qualified health plans to pay for and/or perform harmful procedures that, for many of them, would violate their medical expertise and religious convictions. In short, the rule would violate Americans’ basic rights and harm the very people it seeks to help. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal"},

During his Senate committee confirmation hearing in February, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona affirmed his support for transgender athletes during a line of direct and intensive questioning by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. Cardona stated, “I think that it’s critically important to have education systems and educators respect the rights of all students, including students who are transgender, and that they are afforded the opportunities that every other student has to participate in extracurricular activities.” Cardona on Wednesday cemented his department’s formal position on the matter, indicating that the U.S. Supreme Court’s Bostock v. Clayton County opinion extending workplace discrimination protections under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to gay and transgender employees would likewise be applied by the Department of Education to gay and transgender students under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. “We just want to double down on our expectations,” Cardona said. “Students cannot be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or their gender identity.” On Day One of his administration, President Joe Biden’s executive order on sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination had muddied the waters on Title IX, and a coalition of left- and right-leaning women strenuously urged the Department of Education to clarify precisely what it would do to ensure that the interests of biological women were protected within an educational context, fully aware that Title IX was on the line. Major media outlets such as USA Today’s “fact check” were forced to admit that the executive order called for a “broader application of last year’s Supreme Court Bostock v. Clayton County ruling.” Most executive agencies responded swiftly to Biden’s executive order. On Feb. 11, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced it would be requiring entities covered by the Fair Housing Act to not “discriminate” based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The action gave rise to the School of the Ozarks d/b/a College of the Ozarks v. Biden, a lawsuit challenging the directive for forcing the religious school to violate its beliefs by opening its dormitories, dorm rooms, and shared shower spaces to members of the opposite sex. On May 10, the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would be enforcing Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act to include nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. But the impact on Title IX’s application and enforcement remained unclear until Wednesday. Though Bostock has been cited endlessly for the proposition that the decision demands all civil rights law be altered to reflect sexual orientation and transgender status as stand-ins for sex, Justice Neil Gorsuch began his opinion for the court in that case as follows: “We proceed on the assumption that ‘sex’ signified what the employers suggest, referring only to biological distinctions between male and female.” Title IX requires sexual equality for women, specifically because of their biological distinctions. As I’ve previously written, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act—the law at issue in Bostock—is sex-prohibitive, which is to say, it’s clear about biological sex being irrelevant to employment matters. By contrast, Title IX of the Education Amendments is sex-permissive, which is to say, it’s clear about consideration of biological sex as a relevant and supporting rationale for both the law’s application and its enforcement. Previous Department of Education guidance issued by the Office for Civil Rights had indicated that while Bostock would possibly have salience in relation to sexual orientation (noting that as with Bostock, the point of emphasis was still biological sex, and it therefore demanded the same “nondiscriminatory” outcome), it ought not to guide interpretations of Title IX in relation to transgender students, as by definition, transgender students identified with a gender other than with their biological sex. The opposition of biological sex to gender identity would gut Title IX’s very purpose; namely, to ensure that girls and young women have equal opportunities in education, including sports, bathrooms, and other areas of privacy. In the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, four female athletes continue to battle on. They seek to cabin the Bostock decision and are requesting judicial clarification on whether they must be forced to compete against biological males who “identify” as female under federal law. Helpful to their mission is Gorsuch’s clarifying language in Bostock, in which he anticipated hypotheticals like the one presented by Cardona on Wednesday: Gorsuch’s opinion left the door open to an endless string of questions. Among them: What about religious schools, such as the College of the Ozarks, that refuse to open their sex-separated facilities to members of the opposite sex? What about the states that have passed laws protecting women’s sports, or the public schools that simply refuse to kowtow to the prevailing woke sexual orthodoxy? For now, the Education Department has decided that sex-separated spaces, protected by law for decades under Title IX, ought to be sex-neutral, and has opened up single-sex bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, sports, overnight accommodations, and more at every institution receiving federal money to not just girls and women, but also to those who feel like girls and women. And the department will need to sniff out any perceived violation and pursue them one by one. In the end, it may need to defend its cavalier edict on Title IX at the Supreme Court. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal."},

Citing the Bostock v. Clayton County Supreme Court ruling, the Department of Education released a notice yesterday announcing it would interpret Title IX protections against discrimination on the basis of sex to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Such radical reinterpretation is a step back from “equality for all.” Sadly, the Biden administration’s move is not a surprise. President Joe Biden launched what has become a full-scale effort to dismantle women’s equality. On his first day in office, Biden signed a divisive executive order that expands discrimination on the basis of sex to include sexual orientation and gender identity. A few weeks later, he nominated Miguel Cardona for education secretary. Cardona refused to acknowledge the differences in biological sex for sports during his confirmation hearing. Biden then appointed Rachel Levine for assistant secretary of the Department for Health and Human Services. Levine refused to acknowledge the mutilation of children under the guise of “gender-affirming care.” Just over one month ago, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a notice reinterpreting Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act’s prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex to include sexual orientation and gender identity. The notice cited Bostock v. Clayton County to justify its reinterpretation. The administration’s actions undermine equality for women achieved by Title IX and the meaning and scope of Bostock v. Clayton County. Today, Americans celebrate Title IX’s 49th anniversary. Title IX created equality and opportunity for women in educational institutions that receive federal funding by requiring equal treatment of the sexes. This applied to all education programs and activities, including athletics. Because of Title IX, women’s athletics programs were required to have equal resources for facilities, training, recruitment, and scholarships. As a result, women’s participation in sports exploded. Since 1972, the number of high school female athletes has grown from 295,000 to 2.6 million, and the number of female college athletes has quintupled. Title IX is also credited to have decreased dropout rates and increased the number of women who pursued higher education. Reinterpreting Title IX’s prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex to include gender identity will result in the loss of the hard-won equality, safety, and opportunity for girls and women in school athletics. A recent British Journal of Medicine study shows that trans-identifying biological males retain competitive advantage over females even after two years of taking estrogen. Don’t believe it? Currently, nearly 300 US high school boys can beat Allyson Felix in the 400-meter sprint. Felix is the most decorated athlete in World Athletics Championships history and six-time Olympic gold medalist. Trans-identifying biological males dominate girls’ sports and take away opportunities created for hardworking female athletes. In Maui, Hawaii, Margaret Oneal Monteleone, a sophomore at St. Anthony School, raced against a transgender athlete who effortlessly beat the female competitors. Had she only competed against girls, Monteleone would have won. Losing out on first place can mean losing out on athletic scholarships. The Education Department’s reinterpretation of Title IX not only undermines women’s equality in sports, but it also misapplies and misunderstands the Bostock v. Clayton County ruling. In Bostock v. Clayton County, the Supreme Court’s ruling proceeded “on the assumption that ‘sex’ signified what the employers suggest, referring only to biological distinctions between male and female.” The ruling dealt with discrimination on the basis of sex in matters of employment according to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. It did not redefine sex to include gender identity and sexual orientation. It also did not apply its ruling to any other part of the Civil Rights Act beyond Title VII. This is as it should be. Jobs may be performed equally well by qualified individuals regardless of sex. Unlike matters of employment, however, sexual differences are extremely relevant when it comes to health care and athletics. Amendments like Title IX were passed because biological differences matter when it comes to fairness and opportunities in sports. The Bostock v. Clayton County ruling acknowledges this legal distinction. The Supreme Court explicitly stated that Bostock v. Clayton County cannot be used to apply to matters beyond employment nondiscrimination under Title VII. Despite its lip-service to equality, the Biden administration’s actions speak louder than words. As Americans celebrate Title IX’s anniversary, they must not rest on the accomplishments of the past. There is need for renewed efforts in the fight for women’s equality. Freedom is never more than a generation away from extinction—and women’s freedoms are no exception. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal."},

This is just one of the many heart-breaking stories recounted in the groundbreaking new documentary “Trans Mission: What’s the Rush to Reassign Gender?”. Produced by the Center for Bioethics and Culture, “Trans Mission” is an exposé of the “gender affirming” health care model and its destruction on children’s minds, bodies, and families as told by detransitioners—individuals who have undergone hormonal or surgical interventions to change their gender but decided to revert back—as well as medical professionals and parents of transgender children. The documentary opens with Hacsi, a detransitioned man. While Hacsi was convinced earlier in life that he would be “picnicking on one of Saturn’s moons” before ever destransitioning, he eventually realized he was “undermining women” and could not continue living a masquerade. Reflecting on his own experience, Hacsi warned that people should think more deeply about letting children transition, comparing it to giving children a car or letting them buy drugs. Children do not have “mature judgment” to be making decisions that will have irreversible consequences they cannot possibly understand yet. Jade, a detransitioned woman, expressed similar concerns about allowing children to transition, and urged people to look at the underlying issues. She was molested several times as a child and, without knowing the risks of transitioning, thought being a man would solve her problems. Jade believed transitioning would make it as if the molesting happened to another person. After transitioning, though, the problems remained, and her body was permanently changed. The documentary also told of pediatricians pressuring parents to transition their children before puberty. One such pediatrician featured in the documentary is Michelle Forcier, associate professor of pediatrics and assistant dean of admissions at the Brown University Alpert Medical School, who helps children on their “gender journey.” She compared this journey to a bus ride: The kids are driving the bus, parents are in the front seat, and pediatricians are in the back seat with the roadmap, helping parents and children choose between “safe” and “good” options. But transitioning is far from safe or good. As Dr. Andre Van Mol, a board-certified family medicine doctor, shared in the film, gender-affirming pediatricians frame gender transition in terms of life and death—“Do you want a live son or a dead daughter?”—and state that early stages of transitioning are reversible. But this framing of the problem does not follow the science. As Van Mol explained, there is no long-term evidence that transitioning decreases suicide, and, in fact, it has permanent consequences, ranging from infertility to blood clots. He further shared that pharmaceutical companies are profiting greatly from transgender patients who increase their market share. With so much potential for profit, it’s no wonder that the scientific data is being suppressed or ignored. Emphasizing the importance of addressing underlying issues that are often tied to gender dysphoria, Van Mol encouraged parents and children to pursue “watchful waiting.” Parents, too, are concerned about the uncritical gender-affirming approach. Despite urging from a pediatrician to begin transitioning her daughter, Brynne—one of the multiple parents interviewed—shared why she is pushing back: The documentary also touches on the political and social pressures coming from the U.S. Supreme Court to social media platforms. Natasha Chart, the former executive director of the liberal feminist organization Women’s Liberation Front, told of the threat that the gender ideology behind the gender-affirming model poses to women’s rights. This is why Women’s Liberation Front filed a brief in the Supreme Court case Bostock v. Clayton County in defense of the funeral home’s right to enforce a sex-specific dress code. “A man cannot be a woman,” declared Chart in footage from the Supreme Court rally. “There are doctors who will go to work today and … who will put 14-year-old girls into menopause and give troubled young girls cosmetic mastectomies.” Others have been canceled after speaking out that a man cannot become a woman or vice versa. The documentary featured Canadian journalist and writer Meghan Murphy, who was kicked off Twitter after saying men are not women. Similarly, the film shared the experience of Colin Wright, an evolutionary biologist who left academia. Attacked and deemed a transphobe after following the biology and declaring that sex is not a spectrum, Wright shared his disappointment: “The reason why I wanted to be in academia in the first place was because I thought that was the area that you go when you want to pursue truth.” The film ends on a hopeful but harrowing note: This harmful trend will end, but at what cost? One mother warned it may take enough kids getting harmed before people see the need for change. Dr. Quentin Van Meter, a board-certified pediatric endocrinologist, speculated that change will come when families and individuals file major lawsuits that take down the physicians, drug companies, hospital health care systems, and insurance companies that allowed this harm to children. Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that. “Trans Mission,” directed by Jennifer Lahl and Kallie Fell, is available for viewing on YouTube and Vimeo.

Call it \"woke capital.\" This spring, the Arkansas Legislature passed the Save Adolescents from Experimentation Act to protect children from hormonal and surgical interventions to treat gender dysphoria. When Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson vetoed the bill on April 5, the Walton Family Foundation, the nonprofit group run by the family that owns Walmart, the state’s largest employer, waded in. It praised Hutchinson and condemned the bill for sending \"the wrong message to those willing to invest in or visit\" Arkansas. In political circles, money matters. >>> The Long March Through the Corporations Yet, Arkansas lawmakers in this instance opted to listen to the strongest scientific evidence and the concerns of most parents and voters. Putting the interests of children first, they overrode the governor’s veto. Lawmakers elsewhere should do the same. Across the nation, transgender activists are enlisting the economic and political clout of big corporations to defeat state laws that would protect children from being sterilized by \"sex change procedures\" and keep female athletes from having to compete against biological men. In Missouri, Georgia, and elsewhere, woke corporations have thrown their weight behind bills to limit religious freedom. More than 100 businesses, including Target, Kellogg's, and Nike, that cater to children and women, have signed a statement pledging to oppose protections for female athletes and gender-confused children. These corporations are no longer interested only in delivering the products and services the public wants. They now have political and social agendas of their own. Megacorporations also have access to political pressure points few others can touch. In South Dakota, for instance, legislators expressed fear that passing a bill to protect women's sports would anger Amazon, the corporate behemoth that had begun construction for a fulfillment center in Sioux Falls. They knew that the company, which sells 53% of all books sold in the country, has banned books that question whether children should undergo sex-change operations. Moreover, its CEO, Jeff Bezos, is an outspoken advocate of gay and transgender values. In the end, the Legislature passed the bill, but Gov. Kristi Noem effectively vetoed it by sending it back to the Legislature for \"style and form\" revisions. Corporations are free to articulate positions on debated issues, but we are in a dangerous place when the most powerful forces in our society have unbridled authority to stifle debate by banning books on debated issues. Voters are on the side of these parents. More than 66% disagree with letting children under the age of 18 undergo sex-change surgery or take cross-sex hormones. By the same margin, they oppose letting men or boys who identify as transgender compete in women's and girls' athletics. As Crystal points out, it is parents, not corporations, who care for children. \"We make countless, daily sacrifices, working long hours to make ends meet, taking them to extracurricular activities, caring for them when they are sick—to ensure our children can have the best life possible.\" >>> We’ll Tell You What “60 Minutes+” Won’t About How Transgender Movement Endangers Kids Lawmakers should heed their voices, not billionaire CEOs. Parents and lawmakers are fighting back by endorsing the Promise to America’s Children and introducing bills such as the SAFE Act. And shareholder efforts to call corporations to account are starting to get results. These shareholders understand that protecting the free market and holding woke corporations accountable is not an either/or proposition—we can and should do both. The politicization of corporate America now threatens the freedoms and values most hold dear. If corporate elites are going to muck about in politics, they should consider what the majority of their customers believe is best for their children. That’s not hard to figure out. All they need to do is talk to their key constituencies: customers and shareholders. If legislators can do it, so can Bezos, the Waltons, and the rest of the corporate wokesters."},

In a 68-to-30 vote, the Louisiana House of Representatives narrowly missed the 70 votes needed to override Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards’ veto of the Fairness in Women’s Sports Act, which would have protected female athletes from being forced to compete with biological males. Authored by state Sen. Beth Mizell, the bill requires that all elementary, secondary, and post-secondary schools: With this protective measure vetoed, the future for female athletes in Louisiana is uncertain. While the Republican-controlled state Senate successfully overturned Edwards’ veto before it advanced to the House, the margin of victory was narrow. The Senate’s 26-to-12 party-line vote represented the precise number needed for a two-thirds majority to go to the House. Edwards called the bill discriminatory and a “solution in search of a problem.” He also said the National Collegiate Athletic Association and various athletic championships, including the Final Four, would likely not occur in Louisiana because of this bill. In his formal veto message, Edwards went further, stating that the bill unfairly targets children. Edwards did not mention the documented physiological advantages biological males have over females in athletic competitions. He also did not elaborate upon how this bill would target children. Legislators anticipated Edwards’ veto because he is the Deep South’s only Democratic governor. He broke with governors of other Southern states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Florida, that have enacted their own bills protecting women’s sports. Women’s sports bills have been introduced in 31 states across the country, and rely on a traditional, sex-segregated athletics model, taking their cue from Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972—a law motivated by the need to provide equity for females in all educational formats, and which requires equal athletic opportunities for both males and females in schools receiving federal funding. The flurry of similar legislation across the country has been prompted by the Department of Education’s expansive interpretation of Title IX to include “gender identity” within the statute’s prohibition on sex discrimination. The Education Department’s rationale for the new interpretation was the Supreme Court’s 2020 Bostock v. Clayton County decision. Bostock was an employment discrimination case that expanded the definition of discrimination on the basis of “sex” under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to include discrimination-based sexual orientation and gender identity as well. That case has complicated the application of state and federal anti-discrimination laws and created a patchwork of solutions to ensure protection of all Americans’ civil rights, even as the left moves aggressively to elevate the rights of transgender individuals over biological females and those with religious objections to the new “woke” sexual orthodoxy. Until or unless the Supreme Court hears a challenge to a state law protecting women’s sports or one based on the federal government’s reinterpretation and application of Title IX spawned by last year’s Bostock decision, women’s right to fair play in Louisiana, at least for the time being, remains on the bench.

Yet we hear little about how Western forces are currently reshaping Africa’s culture through economic and political pressure. The United Nations, Western donor nations, multinational corporations and non-governmental organizations act is if they have reached a state of enlightenment, especially when it comes to issues of sexuality. Indeed, they apparently feel compelled to press their enlightened views on the rest of the world. This approach, however, is all too familiar to many Kenyans. It reminds them of times when foreigners conquered African lands and imposed their ideas through force. That is why few Africans celebrate events like the recent Generation Equality Forum in Paris. The event was convened by UN Women and the governments of France and Mexico, where progressive countries and development organizations committed to fund programs aimed at achieving gender equality. That may sound harmless—even good—but gender equality does not simply mean equal opportunities for men and women. In U.N. terms, it means acceptance of Western cultural norms, including comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) for schoolchildren and promotion of contraception and abortion to girls. This is all marketed under the message of empowering women and girls to have “bodily autonomy” in making decisions about their sexuality and reproduction. >>> U.S. Pushes Controversial Abortion and Sexual Rights at U.N.’s Conference on Women These goals may be laudable with respect to ending child marriage or preventing female genital mutilation, but many of these phrases, and the aid programs they include, amount to euphemisms for abortion. The broad and ambiguous term “bodily autonomy,” meanwhile, is used to encompass “sexual orientation, gender identity, transactional sex, surrogacy… and more,” according to the United Nations Population Fund’s 2021 report. Kenya in recent years has seen a sustained and consistent push by western and international actors to have the so-called sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) agenda firmly in the public domain. Abortion is a particularly sensitive touchpoint of this ideological colonialism. While abortion is legal in the U.S and Europe, many societies in Africa do not condone abortion, and do not appreciate its imposition. There are many places in Africa where a strong culture of life exists, and where their priority is to reduce maternal mortality; for these women, the notion of deliberately killing unborn children is especially repugnant. But when one country or institution is offering a grant or aid to another, the tendency is to make such aid conditional on some aspect of societal change. Because of the desperate need of the country receiving the aid or assistance, its leaders are compelled to acquiesce to the demands of the donor. Sometimes the donor countries or their like-minded non-governmental allies will even take legislators from recipient countries to special trainings or workshops, wining and dining them, and offering technical support to draft legislation and policies to facilitate their desired agenda. Although no negotiated UN treaty or document includes a right to abortion, the Generation Equality Forum organizers created a blueprint that demands that world leaders “move from rhetoric to action,” to achieve targets that include eliminating “restrictive policies and legal barriers, ensuring 50 million more adolescent girls and women … can access safe and legal abortion by 2026.” Not to be outdone by multilateral actors, the Biden administration announced a laundry list of U.S. commitments to the Generation Equality Forum that included several pledges that abortion advocates and feminist groups in the U.S. have demanded. Examples include eliminating the Trump-era Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy and removing the Hyde amendment restrictions on taxpayer funding of elective abortions. The Biden budget also increases the earmark for international family planning and reproductive health, which creates a slush fund for international pro-abortion organizations like International Planned Parenthood Federation and Marie Stopes International, who are now unconstrained from promoting abortion with U.S. tax dollars by Biden’s executive order rescinding the Mexico City Policy. In addition, the administration is now reinstating and increasing U.S. contributions to UNFPA, overlooking its complicity with China's coercive abortion and sterilization policies. This insistence on the part of the Biden administration to promote controversial abortion and sexual rights through multilateral fora is not going unnoticed in Africa. Rather, it is increasingly recognized as a form of ideological colonialism. The terms that are used by Western governments and development organizations convey the superiority of some ideas or values over others with words like, “progressive,” “liberal” or “reformist,” while local knowledge or customs are described as “repugnant,” “non-reformist,” or “conservative.” This has the intended effect of gaslighting Africans into second-guessing their own positions. Cultural imperialism has succeeded in weaponizing some words to the point where they are completely devoid of any positive meaning, such as “patriarchy” or “patriarchal.” As a result, religious or cultural practices that are deemed “patriarchal” are vilified, such as the role of fathers in making decisions about children, or religiously motivated abstinence before marriage and faithfulness in marriage. Multinational businesses that are big employers, wealthy philanthropists, and world influencers engage in this ideological colonialism too. Any attempt to slow down this trend is considered “push back,” accompanied by economic, political, and social repercussions. Many who object find themselves censored on social media or flagged for offending community rules. International nongovernmental organizations like Ipas and Marie Stopes International come to the developing world under a humanitarian guise and push their radical social agenda. Their programming often comes in under the rubric of sexual and reproductive health, but actually promotes abortion. >>> Biden Budget Would Scrap Decades of Consensus on Not Funding Abortion For example, they may sponsor and operate clinics that offer a variety of health services but are simultaneously and covertly providing illegal abortion services. Or they will form educational groups under the premise of teaching life skills to children, while also teaching controversial comprehensive sexuality education curriculums designed and delivered by International Planned Parenthood Federation. The adverse effects of this ideological colonialism will take time to manifest, and by the time they do, it will be too late to wind back the clock. What radicals cannot achieve today in African societies will be more easily achieved over the long-term by creating “home grown activism,” a kind of insider ideological sabotage, by targeting their messages to the youth. Parents can tell off a foreigner, but what can they do when their own children discard what they learn at home for what they are taught in school? Certainly the inter-connectivity of the world today is creating cultural commonalities. Eventually African societies may adopt some of the values and culture from the West. However, these changes should be organic and voluntary, not forced through conditional aid. And as much as the West can influence African ideas, African values must also be permitted to pollinate the West. To counter the ongoing ideological colonialism, we must employ some countercultural measures of our own. While liberal activism is rampant, there are many more Westerners, including Americans, who respect and even admire African culture. Amplifying this message is needed so that more people, and their leaders, in Africa and the West have the courage to resist what need not be inevitable."},

Kim", "Giovanna  Milano"], "date": "Aug 3, 2021 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/economic-freedom-best-path-womens-equality-empowerment", "takeaways": ["The best environment to promote equality is a free market economy that emphasizes a strong rule of law, regulatory efficiency, and open markets.", "Because these economically unfree countries do not have fair and dependable rule of law...their women can be subject to oppression and even abuse.", "Creating just and equal laws that hold our nations accountable in respecting and upholding women’s equality is essential."], "text": "Women’s battle for equal rights under the law has progressed significantly in a number of countries, but many other nations still have much room for improvement to establish societies that uphold women’s equality and dignity. So, what’s the solution to decreasing this gender gap worldwide? There’s considerable evidence that the best environment to promote equality is a free market economy that emphasizes a strong rule of law, regulatory efficiency, and open markets. The World Bank Group’s Women, Business and the Law 2021 annual report outlines the importance of gender equality for women’s economic empowerment and involvement in business. The report scores and ranks 190 countries in eight areas: mobility, pay, parenthood, assets, workplace, marriage, entrepreneurship, and pensions. Putting those results together with the rankings from The Heritage Foundation’s annual Index of Economic Freedom reveals the importance for economic freedom in promoting women’s equality. (The Daily Signal is the news outlet of The Heritage Foundation.) For example, New Zealand, the second-most economically free country in the world, according to the Index of Economic Freedom, received a 97.5 out of 100 on the Women, Business and the Law index, supporting the notion that free market economies empower and enable women to make their own life choices. Similarly, the fifth-most economically free economy in the world, Ireland, scored a perfect 100 on the Women, Business and the Law index. By contrast, countries such as Pakistan, ranked 152nd on Heritage’s index, and Lebanon, ranked 154th, both scored below 60 on the 2021 Women, Business and the Law index. Because these economically unfree countries do not have fair and dependable rule of law, regulatory efficiency, or open markets, and usually have large, powerful governments that intrude into people’s lives, their women can be subject to oppression and even abuse. While the Women, Business and the Law index does not directly answer the question of how to create an equal society, the report points out—in accord with The Heritage Foundation’s annual Index of Economic Freedom—the importance of strong property rights and judicial integrity, and effectiveness in creating an equal and prosperous society for women and men alike. One of the foundations for economic freedom is the upholding of a just rule of law, which includes the protection of property rights and judicial effectiveness. In countries that have a strong rule of law, such as Ireland and New Zealand, women are more inclined “to leverage assets for economic gain, increasing their financial security and providing them with the collateral needed to start a business,” according to the Women, Business and the Law 2021 report. A strong rule of law that includes protection of physical and intellectual property not only grants a woman the autonomy to establish her own business, but also gives her the ability to fairly and equally compete in the market. Similarly, when the laws in place are effectively and justly carried out by a society’s judicial system, a woman recognizes that laws are in place for her protection and are in her best interest. Unfortunately, in countries where property rights are ignored, and the law fails to justly protect its people, a woman is usually the first to be given the short end of the stick. She is discouraged from contributing to the market because there do not exist laws that protect her entrepreneurial ability or grant her entrepreneurial liberty. While a strong rule of law proves essential to women’s equality, so do regulatory efficiency, including business, labor, and monetary freedom; and open-market policies, such as trade, investment, and financial freedom. Heritage’s annual index outlines how regulatory efficiency encourages entrepreneurship, and when women are allowed the ability to creatively and freely enter the marketplace as both buyers and sellers, economic growth results. Creating just and equal laws that hold our nations accountable in respecting and upholding women’s equality is essential. And, in fact, economic freedom is the proven foundation for empowering women with greater and more opportunities. Having economic freedom allows women the liberty to own their labor, as well as exercise their entrepreneurial spirits to the greatest possible degree. That’s the ultimate way to empower women.

The policy describes the medical, logistical, and administrative processes involved to switch gender identities. It follows quickly on the heels of President Joe Biden’s executive order that he signed on the fifth day of his administration, setting aside the previous policy that barred service by transgender individuals suffering from gender dysphoria. >>> Identity Politics and Critical Race Theory Have No Place in U.S. Military Under this new transition policy, individuals are expected to obtain a diagnosis from the military medical system that gender transition is necessary, and then present that information to their commanders. Under the policy, commanders then must act on that request within 90 days. Once transgender individuals receive a diagnosis that a gender transition is “medically necessary,” they will receive the associated medical care and treatment at taxpayer expense. Common gender transition medical treatments presumably authorized under this policy would include “hormone therapy; chest, face, genital or other gender affirming surgeries; hair removal; speech therapy; and fertility preservation.” The policy also states that once an individual’s request to change gender is approved, their administrative record will be changed to reflect that new gender, and the service member must then immediately adhere to the new standards for uniforms, grooming, physical readiness testing, and body composition. Although the policy states that commanders are expected to “ensure readiness by minimizing impacts to the mission,” the policy is silent on how commanders are supposed to accomplish that task when service members go absent for significant periods of time to recover from medical treatments or to receive associated counseling. The previous administration’s policy on service by transgender individuals sought to strike a balance between allowing as many individuals as possible to serve, while at the same time, ensuring that those who joined the military were medically fit and would not be harmed by military service. For that reason, it specifically prohibited transgender individuals who were diagnosed with gender dysphoria from service, while at the same time allowing all others to volunteer and serve. Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis developed that policy over the course of six months of study, during which he consulted with a team of medical experts and military leaders. Biden set that policy aside after just five days in office. The Mattis study found evidence individuals with gender dysphoria suffer severe anxiety and attempt suicide at approximately nine times the rate of the general population. He therefore recommended to the president that this condition—gender dysphoria—be considered disqualifying for military service, as it posed both increased danger to individuals and risks to the military readiness of their units. Biden’s order set that policy aside, seemingly disregarding the dangers, thus exposing individuals already at greater risk from mental harm to the extreme stresses of military duty. His new policy also jeopardizes military readiness by introducing individuals who may, through no fault of their own, let their comrades down at the moment of greatest need. Compounding those risks, the new policy means that military commanders must juggle yet another spinning plate—the need to accommodate service members who wish to change their genders with medical and other time-consuming treatments. With all the other challenges the military must deal with, this new policy is an unforced error. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal."},

The court’s decision is the first of its kind, and establishes a needed boundary against American culture’s new, brutish sexual orthodoxy. At least within academia, one can no longer be compelled to say things one doesn’t believe. The incident that precipitated this suit occurred in January 2018, when Shawnee State philosophy professor Nicolas Meriwether responded to a male student’s question during a Socratic dialogue in his political philosophy class by saying, “Yes, sir.” After class, the student approached Meriwether, stated that he was transgender, and demanded that the professor refer to him as a woman, with feminine titles and pronouns. Instead, Meriwether offered to use the student’s last name, or any other name of the student’s choosing, but politely declined to use the transgender student’s pronouns. The student became belligerent and promised to get Meriwether fired. The student then filed a complaint with the university, which launched a formal investigation through the university’s Title IX office. Meriwether again offered various compromises in an attempt to protect his rights of conscience while being respectful to the transgender student, but the university rejected any arrangement other than the use of preferred pronouns, or the elimination of sex-based pronouns altogether (a virtual impossibility in a scholastic setting). When Meriwether refused, the university formally charged him with a violation of Title IX, claiming “he [had] effectively created a hostile environment” for the student. The university placed a written warning in Meriwether’s personnel file and threatened “further corrective actions” unless he articulated the university’s groupthink. Two years prior, in 2016, Meriwether had received a faculty-wide email from Shawnee State leadership, directing all faculty to refer to students by their preferred pronouns. At that time, Meriwether, a devout Christian, had approached his department chair, Jennifer Pauley, with concerns about the policy. Pauley was not only dismissive of Meriwether’s concerns, she was patently hostile. Knowing Meriwether had successfully taught courses on Christian thought for decades, Pauley claimed Christians are “primarily motivated out of fear,” and “should be banned from teaching courses regarding that religion.” In her view, even the “presence of religion in higher education is counterproductive.” Meriwether was told that even if a professor had moral or religious objections to the use of preferred pronouns, the policy would still apply. Two years later, Meriwether’s spotless record was marred by a disciplinary note, and he was teaching under the threat of further discipline, including suspension without pay or termination, unless he agreed to fall in line with Shawnee’s pronoun policy. In November 2018, Meriwether sued the university in Ohio federal court for violation of his rights of free speech and religious liberty under the First Amendment, and violation of his due process and equal protection rights under the 14th Amendment. U.S. District Judge Susan Dlott threw out Meriwether’s lawsuit on Feb. 12, 2020, and among other things, held that a professor’s speech in the classroom is never protected by First Amendment. Meriwether appealed to the 6th Circuit. In Meriwether v. Hartop et al., an impatient panel for the 6th Circuit wasted no time with perfunctory legalese or institutional pandering. It cut right to the chase in its frustration with Shawnee State’s stamping out of debate and open dialogue vis-a-vis its malignant speech policy. The opinion, which was written by Judge Amul Thapar and joined by Judge Joan Larsen and Senior Judge David McKeague, begins: The court went on to clarify that the Supreme Court has recognized that the government may not compel a speaker to affirm a belief with which the speaker disagrees. It added that courts have recognized that the free speech clause of the Constitution applies at public universities, and that “professors do not shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the [university] gate.” Thapar, the first South Asian federal judge in American history, and the son of self-made immigrants from India, seemed hard-pressed in containing his displeasure at the university’s looseness with long-standing judicial principles. It’s clear he doesn’t take kindly to Shawnee State’s loutish attempts at conformity. In relaying a dizzying body of precedent, Thapar stressed that the court has rejected as “totally unpersuasive” the argument that “teachers have no First Amendment rights when teaching, or that the government can censor teacher speech without restriction.” Simply put, the judge wrote, professors at public universities retain First Amendment protections at least when engaged in core academic functions, such as teaching and scholarship because the need for free exchange of ideas in the college classroom is unlike that of other workplace settings. In a critical discussion on the use of pronouns themselves, Thapar wrote: The court’s opinion in Meriwether v. Hartop is long overdue comfort to those who refuse to bend the knee on leftist groupthink—the kind that forces a subjective and manipulable view of one person’s self to become a defining reality for everyone else. It is a stake in the ground on behalf of religious dissenters and academic freedom. And—with poetic suitability to a Socratic dialogue—the decision reminds us that there are no “personal” truths, but only truths immemorial: realities that exists independent of our wishes to the contrary.

Asa Hutchinson signed bills protecting women’s sports and medical conscience protections from being forced to bend to progressive gender ideology, he now has the chance to sign yet another pro-science bill that would protect children from harmful surgical and hormonal interventions on their bodies in the name of “gender affirmation” and “transgender medicine.” The Arkansas General Assembly on Monday passed HB 1570, the Save Adolescents From Experimentation (SAFE) Act. The bill would prevent the chemical and surgical destruction of minors’ genitalia by preventing doctors from prescribing puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones or performing surgeries to “affirm gender identity” for children and youths under 18 years of age. The American Civil Liberties Union has wrongly decried the bill as “banning trans youth from accessing health care and health insurance.” The bill does no such thing. The lives of transgender individuals aren’t under attack. No transgender youth will be turned away from basic health care services or facilities. In fact, the Arkansas bill would save lives by ensuring that children who struggle with gender dysphoria will be provided the best science- and evidence-based treatments to ensure lifelong health and wellness. Research shows that between 88% and 98% of gender dysphoric children will reconcile with their bodily sex if allowed to go through puberty without hormonal interventions. Conversely, hormonal and surgical interventions on children’s bodies, such as puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgical procedures have been shown to lead to cardiovascular disease, loss of bone density, and sterilization. Moreover, the science shows that those who undergo so-called “transition” surgeries experience no mental health benefits and are 19 times more likely than the average population to commit suicide. Given that no lasting psychological health benefits are gained as a result of transitioning, bills like Arkansas’ measure that prevent gender dysphoric children from rushing into irreversible sex-change interventions, whether chemical or surgical, actually save lives and ensure health. While this bill is the first of its kind to be passed at the state level, both Democrats and Republicans in other states have introduced similar legislation. In South Carolina, Rep. Cezar McKnight, a Democrat, has authored and introduced the South Carolina Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act, which would prevent children from receiving hormones, puberty blockers, or undergoing “transition” procedures. In Congress, Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., and Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., have introduced a similar bill that would offer federal protection for children from such life-altering, irreversible, genital-mutilating interventions. Alongside legislative efforts in state legislatures and Congress, thousands of Americans have signed The Promise to America’s Children, a national grassroots movement created to protect children in their minds, bodies, and relationships with their parents. The Promise coalition focuses on exposing bad policies that would normalize genital mutilation by imposing destructive gender ideology as orthodoxy, and on highlighting good policies that protect children’s health, free speech in education, and parental rights. Both the legislative and grassroots effort come in response to the Biden administration’s radical transgender agenda. Since taking office Jan. 20, President Joe Biden has issued executive orders that harm women’s equality, especially in sports, under the guise of “trans rights.” He has also promised to sign the Equality Act, which, by imposing progressive gender ideology as legal orthodoxy, would effectively outlaw any doctor, counselor, or facility that does not provide irreversible hormonal and surgical “transition” procedures and legally sanction the mutilation of some of America’s most vulnerable and emotionally distressed children. While some governors have failed to stand firm in critical political skirmishes with the radical left and its Big Tech allies in their war on America’s children, Hutchinson should follow the lead of the Arkansas legislature by heeding the science and protecting doctors, children, and their parents from the politicization of medicine. Hopefully, other lawmakers will have the courage to follow suit. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal."},

It would seem the answer is “no.” A federal district court judge in Connecticut on Sunday dismissed a lawsuit that had been filed by four female high school track athletes who have been fighting since 2019 to keep biological boys from competing in girls scholastic sports. The lawsuit was brought against the Connecticut Association of Schools (operating as the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference), as well as the public school boards of education in Bloomfield, Cromwell, Glastonbury, Canton, and Danbury, Connecticut. Counsel for the female athletes, the Alliance Defending Freedom, has indicated its intention to appeal the ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Robert Chatigny, an appointee of President Bill Clinton. The plaintiffs’ legal journey began with the filing of a complaint under Title IX of the Civil Rights Act with the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education. That office initiated an investigation and found a violation, which led to litigation initiated by the Justice Department under President Donald Trump. Recently, however, the Biden administration’s education secretary, Miguel Cardona, ordered the withdrawal of its enforcement litigation against the schools. In March 2020, in a separate lawsuit brought by the Alliance Defending Freedom on behalf of the four track athletes against the schools, then-Attorney General William Barr had signed a statement of interest, as had the Office of Civil Rights. But in February, both the Justice Department and the Department of Education withdrew their support for the lawsuit. Cardona, who expressed support for transgender athletes during his Senate confirmation hearing, was undoubtedly instrumental in the position switch. From the outset, the Connecticut Association of Schools has stated that it was simply following the state’s anti-discrimination policy in opening girls sports to biological boys. Transathlete.com says that Connecticut is one of 16 states with “friendly policies that help facilitate full inclusion of trans/non-binary/GNC (gender non-conforming) students in high school athletics.” For many, the dismissal of this high-profile case is a discouraging gut-punch in the battle to maintain Title IX’s hard-fought protections for girls and young women as they pursue educational opportunities within sports and scholarship—to say nothing of what Title IX’s unilateral expansion to biological boys would do to locker rooms, bathrooms, and other private spaces. While often cited as the basis for an overly broad and knee-jerk expansion to the whole canon of federal civil rights law in bills like the Equality Act, the often overlooked fact remains that in his majority opinion in 2020’s landmark letdown, Bostock v. Clayton County, Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch clarified that the ruling on Title VII’s expansion of “sex discrimination” to include sexual orientation and transgender status was not to be construed as applicable to other federal civil rights laws: In his ruling dismissing the plaintiffs’ case, Chatigny indicated that “[t]he request to enjoin enforcement of the [Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference] policy has become moot due to the graduation of [transgender athletes Andraya Yearwood and Terry Miller], whose participation in girls’ track provided the impetus for this action.” In determining that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate the case was still ripe for determination relative to the principal form of relief at issue—an injunction preventing enforcement of the Connecticut school policy—the judge noted that two of the plaintiffs (Selina Soule and Chelsea Mitchell) had also graduated and were no longer eligible to compete in school sports. As for the two other female athletes, Alanna Smith and Ashley Nicoletti, who are still students in the associated school districts and have another year of eligibility, the judge said the plaintiffs had requested application of a too-strict standard for determinations of mootness. All that was required for claims of mootness, Chatigny stressed, was whether “the issues presented are no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.” Because there was “no indication that Smith and Nicoletti will encounter competition by a transgender student in a [Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference-sponsored] event next season” and no one could identify transgender athletes who would be participating against Smith and Nicoletti in girls track next year, the judge concluded that their claims, too, were moot. And what about the possibility that transgender athletes could be late entries into the girls track program? Chatigny had an answer for that, too: A “legally cognizable injury to these plaintiffs would depend on a transgender student running in the same events and achieving substantially similar times.” If it looks like Chatigny was straining for a pretext to dismiss the suit, it’s because he most likely was. It’s worth noting that from the outset of the litigation, Chatigny’s political preferences were clear. During the course of litigation, he ordered the Alliance Defending Freedom attorneys for the plaintiff female athletes to refer to the transgender athletes as “females” in a blistering rebuke during a conference call in May 2020. Plaintiffs’ attorney Roger Brooks countered that the biology of the trans-identifying male athletes is precisely the reason they possess an advantage over the female athletes, and later filed a motion to disqualify Chatigny for “judicial bias.” In his order Sunday granting defendants’ motion to dismiss, Chatigny referred to this incident in a footnote on Page 5: Understanding that language shapes both law and policy, the accurate identification of Yearwood and Miller as “biological males” provides the basis upon which the four female athletes’ claims of competitive disadvantage rest. It seemed obvious from the outset that Chatigny would ultimately dismiss the lawsuit. Perhaps the judges for the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals will approach the case with the judicial impartiality and textual fidelity required of members of the bench.

Under President Biden’s new policy, individuals who identify as transgender, and have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, will not only be allowed to serve in the U.S. military, but will have their “gender transitions” paid for by American taxpayers. Biden’s policy undoes decades of military practice, and more importantly, decades of common sense. Facts are important here. Before 2016, U.S. military policy generally did not allow transgender individuals to enlist. In 2016, the Obama administration changed the policy to allow unrestricted military service by transgender individuals, including those with gender dysphoria. >>> Change to Military Transgender Policy Opts for Political Correctness Over Military Readiness After months of careful study, the Pentagon under Defense Secretary James Mattis modified this policy, prohibiting individuals from serving if they were suffering from gender dysphoria, or had a recent history of suffering from the condition. Everyone else who was qualified could serve. Many on the left and in the media falsely termed this a “transgender ban,” when in fact, it was anything but. It was an important step taken only after thoughtful deliberation to ensure that America’s men and women in uniform were not put at risk in a rush to engage in social engineering with our armed forces. The facts show that thrusting individuals with gender dysphoria into a stressful military environment would have devastating consequences. The report issued by the administration in 2019 uncovered several striking findings from medical experts: These numbers are critically important in ways that America’s elites will never understand. Military service is inherently stressful, especially so in a combat environment. Every member of the unit depends on the person next to him or her. They have trained and worked together constantly. Their relationship is one of trust—they know everyone has each other’s back. Allowing mistrust or uncertainty into the unit weakens this critical bond. It breeds resentment. It causes doubt where once was certainty. This is the heart of the transgender service debate. If those with gender dysphoria are at a much higher risk of suicide, crippling anxiety or other mental breakdowns than their peers, those serving next to them will be reluctant to rely on them. Permitting them to serve also violates the principle of not placing individuals at greater risk of injury in harm’s way. Further, the Pentagon is creating a class of potentially non-deployable service members. The physical standards for deployments, even non-combat deployments, are rigorous and exacting, and do not allow for the intense medical requirements of “gender transition” procedures or their aftermath. This will harm readiness not just by reducing the number of available warfighters, but by breeding resentment among units who have members everyone knows will not be called upon to deploy with the rest of the unit. >>> “Transitioning” Procedures Don’t Help Mental Health, Largest Dataset Shows Not only is the Biden administration allowing these fractures to develop, it is actively encouraging them. This policy will weaken the U.S. military and signal to our enemies that the force is more concerned with political correctness than in challenging our adversaries and protecting our interests. While China and Russia are busy investing in their military capabilities and seeking new ways to kill Americans and threaten our interests, the Biden administration is promising to not only welcome individuals with once-disqualifying medical conditions into the ranks, but to reward those individuals with taxpayer-funded “gender reassignment” surgeries and time off away from their unit and training regimen to recover. But don’t worry—those taxpayer dollars will only add up to “a handful of a million dollars,” according to the Pentagon. As usual, the consequences of this decision will be felt by the men and women responsible for our security, not the policymakers in D.C."},

The very first of these was religious liberty—a concept that goes to the very core of who we are as free-thinking, self-determined individuals. The so-called Equality Act, which would make 59 substantive changes to federal law, would completely undermine this liberty. After passing the House in February, the act is currently languishing in the Senate, and faces the not-impossible chance of a 50-50 tie vote broken by the Democratic White House. In an attempt to stop the hemorrhaging on an unprecedented power grab by Democrats, some have proffered the Fairness for All Act as the Equality Act’s kinder, “gentler” alternative. Kinder and gentler, it is not. >>> 11 Myths About H.R. 5, the Equality Act of 2021 Instead, the bill parses out a complex selection of piecemeal protections for organizations meeting various conditions on an ad hoc basis. It protects some business under religious liberty’s ministerial exception to general discrimination law. It shields some churches (so long as the buildings aren’t used for commercial purposes), some marriage and family education providers (so long as they discriminate on “religious character” and not gender identity or sexual orientation), and some religious charities (so long as they receive funds “indirectly” through a voucher system). It’s a master class in death by a thousand cuts. Worse, the Fairness for All Act leaves individual objectors with no recourse. The message to private religious citizens, educators, medical professionals, scholastic athletes, or wedding service providers is clear: “Submit, or else. Your religion be hanged.” Some claim Fairness for All would “expand religious liberty.” This description is patently false. The Supreme Court has repeatedly punted on the balance between religious freedom and the new sexual orthodoxy—including in last year’s now-watershed Bostock v. Clayton County. There, Justice Neil Gorsuch described the Religious Freedom Restoration Act—Congress’s border wall against the Supreme Court’s poor religious liberty jurisprudence—as “a kind of super statute, displacing the normal operation of other federal laws” that might even supersede the commands of anti-discrimination laws (like Title VII) in certain cases. But the Supreme Court has recognized that even within the context of public accommodations, individuals cannot be forced to convey a message with which they don’t agree. In a unanimous decision, the Court in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston (1995) held that to force private citizens organizing a parade to include a group expressing a message with which the organizers did not agree violated the First Amendment. To do so, the Court clarified, would make private speech subordinate to a public accommodation requirement. Insofar as the High Court has recognized that private citizens have the autonomy to choose what to say and what not to say, it is no stretch to say that compelling the religiously faithful to believe or not believe something, or to act or not act in a way contrary to their beliefs, is likewise impermissible, if not more so. No one of sound mind or good character wants to discriminate against someone because of their sexuality of gender identity. But to equate subjective belief and action with the immutable characteristic of race disparages the hard-fought gains of the Civil Rights movement and sets up a battle between religious liberty and sexual identarianism that cannot be won by painting all religious dissenters as discriminatory bigots. We dare not subjugate someone’s constitutionally enumerated rights to another’s perceived dignitary harms as part of an evolving cannon of law on sexual and gender fluidity. Particularly when the SOGI-protected class have a plethora of choices to address their needs and desires (a different doctor, a different florist, a different class, a different charity), while leaving the faithful with the Hobson’s choice of violating their consciences or facing a legal juggernaut if they stand firm on their beliefs. >>> The 6th Circuit Reached the Right Conclusion on “Preferred Pronouns.” Other Courts Should Follow Suit. Fairness for All does not ensure fairness. Instead, it grants special privileges and imposes a unitary, politically correct, legally enforceable set of beliefs about sexuality and gender on all private actors: something the Supreme Court has patently refused to do. And if you think the left will be satisfied with this misguided bill, think again. The ACLU has said Fairness for All “doesn’t protect LGBTQ+ people.” They’ve been joined by the Human Rights Campaign (the country’s biggest LGBTQ+ civil rights group), LAMBDA Legal, and the gay advocacy group GLAAD in proclaiming that the bill “licenses discrimination.” The “compromise” that is Fairness for All is even viewed by the left as an insufficient attempt to protect their interests. It is all or nothing. As it always was. In 2015, conservatives decried Obergefell v. Hodges, arguing that the majority’s judicial activism represented a slippery slope in the cultural conflict between religious and sexual freedoms. It seems they were right."},

The Equality Act Would Make It Worse.", "author": ["Jared  Eckert", "Makenna  McCoy"], "date": "Jun 11, 2021 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/marriage-and-family/commentary/young-children-are-being-targeted-sexual-content-the-equality-act", "takeaways": ["As this year’s LGBT+ Pride Month has shown, young children need not look any further than their living rooms or classrooms for highly sexualized content.", "By directly targeting children, corporations, media, and schools are seeking to normalize sexual content that is inappropriate and confusing for young audiences.", "Parents must commit to their children’s welfare by becoming aware of what their children are watching and reading and stay informed on what schools are teaching."], "text": "Dating back to the 1860s, Americans celebrate National Children’s Day on June 13 to recognize the gift of children and need to foster their welfare and future. John Ross, founder of the grassroots movement that advocated National Children’s Day, says Americans “need this day to love, evaluate, and commit to the betterment of our children.” What better way is there to support children’s “betterment” than by evaluating what corporations, the media, and schools are exposing children to? As this year’s LGBT+ Pride Month has shown, young children need not look any further than their kitchen tables, living rooms, or classrooms for highly sexualized content. This Pride Month, Kellogg’s released its “Together With Pride” cereal for kids. It features a tear-out “Together Band” that children can use to share their pronouns. The cereal company is donating $3 for every box sold to GLAAD, an LGBT group. At an age when children are still figuring out what two plus two is, Kellogg’s teaches kids that they must choose and express their pronouns. Likewise, the popular children’s cartoon “Blue’s Clues” aired an episode featuring a song that celebrates LGBT+ identities. Sung by a cartoon drag queen, the song praises families with gay, lesbian, transgender, and nonbinary members, concluding that “Ace, bi, and pan grownups, you see, can love each other so proudly.” The song, following the melody of “The Ants Go Marching,” further pushes LGBT awareness by giving one of the beavers in the cartoon scars from a double mastectomy surgery. The show is intended for preschoolers—children that are just learning their colors and numbers. Even LEGO introduced its rainbow set called “Everyone Is Awesome” just ahead of Pride Month. The set was released in honor of children—the largest demographic of LEGO consumers—the creator of the set claimed, saying, “Children are our role models, and they welcome everyone, no matter their background.” And yet, although the majority of LEGO users are children, the box indicates the set as appropriate for those 18 years and older. These are just a few examples of products aimed at exposing children to sexual content. There are also the Care Bears phone cases, Teletubbies Pride Collection, Disney Rainbow Gear, and gay Captain America. Messages that introduce children to extreme sexual content are also coming from schools. During a sex ed class for first graders at a New York private school, a teacher showed a cartoon video that explains how it “feels good” for girls and boys to touch their private parts. The video concludes that “it’s OK to touch yourself and see how different body parts feel, but it’s best to only do it in private.” Fortunately, parents became aware of this content, and the school subsequently removed the video. It took the work of vigilant parents to remove a video that is entirely inappropriate for 6-year-olds who should be learning how to read, not how to masturbate. A school in Washington state also exposed first graders to sexual content by reading the book “I Am Jazz,” which promotes transgenderism. In California, third graders had to complete an assignment that referenced “experimenting with gender presentation” and the “gender spectrum.” By directly targeting children, corporations, media, and schools are seeking to normalize sexual content that is inappropriate and confusing for young audiences. In many instances, the content could be considered pornographic material, and some have described the process of normalizing as the first step in grooming children for sexual acts. Beth Bukoski, an associate professor at the University of Texas’ College of Education, revealed what is going on when she said: What Bukoski fails to take into account is the vast body of research that details the harm of exposing children to sexual content at too young of an age. In contrast to what the UN Children’s Fund may want parents to believe, early exposure to pornography is linked to poor “mental health, life satisfaction, sexual behavior and attitudes, and pornography viewing patterns in adulthood.” This means that even if children may not fully understand what they are seeing and hearing, they are influenced by those messages and may begin to act on them. Policies like the Equality Act and Fairness for All, which enshrine radical gender ideology in civil rights law, would only lead to the increased sexualization and harm of young children. The Equality Act would especially open the door for a mandate to include sexual orientation and gender identity ideology in school curricula, while not allowing states or parents to opt out of this kind of curricula. And while Fairness for All is a well-intended compromise solution, it too would leave children vulnerable to gender ideology. This is why parents and lawmakers have signed “The Promise to America’s Children,” a commitment to oppose legislation that harms children and to protect their minds, bodies, and relationships with their parents. Stopping the Equality Act and any policy that includes radical gender ideology in law will help protect children from the harms of premature exposure to sexual content. Ultimately, parents are the ones best suited to determine the right timing to tell their children about sensitive sexual issues, not a cereal company or kindergarten teacher. On National Children’s Day, and every day, parents must commit to their children’s welfare by becoming aware of what their children are watching and reading and stay informed on what schools are teaching. Only by doing this can parents safeguard their children from the aggressive push to expose kids to sexual content, advancing from all fronts. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal."},

"], "text": "The site is one of the country’s biggest video game streaming platforms, where avid gamers can watch their favorite games played by larger-than-life personalities. According to some estimates, as many as 2.3 million people could be watching Twitch streams at any given second. And a large chunk of those viewers are children. While Twitch does not release user data for age brackets under 16, some of the most watched games on the site are things like “Fortnite,” “Minecraft,” and “Valorant,” games incredibly popular with elementary and middle school aged kids. The left has recognized the potential for Twitch to target kids, and has actively begun infiltrating the platform, infesting it with woke propaganda and PC culture. In the most recent incident of woke virtue signaling, Twitch released a tweet, which has since been deleted, encouraging people to “celebrate Womxn’s History Month.” The term “womxn,” in the constantly evolving language of woke leftism, was considered a more inclusive term than “woman,” as it includes men who identify as women and women who don’t identify as either sex. The tweet was immediately met with backlash from both sides of the aisle. Many argued that Twitch was erasing women by using the PC term and pretending that men who identify as women are the same as actual women. Alarmingly, a larger contingent argued that Twitch hadn’t gone far enough. Leftists angrily accused Twitch of transphobia for using the word ‘womxn’ and for daring to imply a man is not the same as a woman just because he says he is. In a move that shocked absolutely no one, Twitch caved to the woke mob and issued an apology, writing: This is not the first time Twitch has promoted PC terms and gone all in on identity politics. In September 2020, Twitch highlighted “Hispanic and LatinX” streamers for “National Hispanic Heritage Month,” and in December 2020, the site removed the “blind playthrough” video tag—a classification meaning the game was being played for the first time with no prior knowledge—as it could be offensive to the visually impaired. Perhaps the most disturbing indication of how deep the roots of identity politics go on Twitch is the “Safety Advisory Council,” an Orwellian group that exists almost completely to ban people from the platform for wrongthink. One member of the council, a man who goes by the online handle “FerociouslySteph,” identifies not only as a woman, but as a deer. He’s also on record encouraging the looting and rioting from last summer. And he gets to decide what your kid is seeing. Twitch represents the pinnacle of nightmarish woke capitalism: a site designed for the sole purpose of connecting gamers with people playing the games they enjoy has been co-opted by leftists hellbent on turning it into a propaganda engine. Worse, Twitch’s young audience provides fertile ground for indoctrination. Children won’t even notice that the site they watch “Fortnite” on is pushing leftist ideology. They’ll just passively absorb what Twitch tells them, be it “women aren’t real” or “it’s offensive to say ‘blind.’” The cultural power that the radical left currently wields is immense. Companies like Twitch that wave the woke banner by purging anti-leftist dissent from their platforms are, in the words of Chris Rufo, a visiting scholar at The Heritage Foundation, “demolishing the old culture to claim hegemony for the new one.” If we as Americans want to keep our traditional values, or frankly even the option of having those values at all, we must stand up and protect them. They will not defend themselves. The culture war is nothing new. But as the left continues its push for total control of the creative industries, it’s America’s children who will suffer the most.

The high court issued a decision last June in Bostock v. Clayton County, a landmark 6-3 opinion holding that discrimination “on the basis of sex” for the purposes of Title VII (which forbids discrimination in employment) includes discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Although the majority began with the supposition that “sex” within the statute meant biological sex, it reasoned that biological sex was inextricably connected to both sexual orientation and gender identity. Writing for the majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch claimed that this was “straightforward application of legal terms with plain and settled meanings.” In his dissent, though, Justice Samuel Alito called the majority’s decision “legislation.” The court held that “on the basis of sex” in the context of employment discrimination includes sexual preference and gender identity, even though it acknowledged that when Congress passed the law in 1964, it meant the term “sex” to include only biological sex. The Bostock decision immediately raised the question of whether “on the basis of sex” means sexual orientation and gender identity for all other laws that use that term—and there are several. For example, if Bostock applied to Title IX, which forbids discrimination in education, it would seem to also forbid single-sex sports teams and sex-specific bathrooms and locker rooms. To be sure, Gorsuch tried to cabin the court’s decision to Title VII, saying, “[W]e have not had the benefit of adversarial testing about the meaning of [other statutes’] terms, and we do not prejudge any such question today.” The problem with that, however, is that it’s not the way lower courts work. What matters for them when they are deciding similar—but not identical—cases to ones decided by the Supreme Court is the reasoning. And there were plenty of reasons to expect the lower courts would take Bostock and run with it. Now that some time has passed, we’ve been able to look at what the lower courts have done with Bostock, at least so far, and, sure enough, they’ve applied it to other statutes. In at least a dozen cases, the courts have unsurprisingly extended Bostock’s definition of “sex” in Title VII to other statutes. In Grimm v. Gloucester County School Board and Adams v. School Board of St. Johns County, for example, the 4th and 11th Circuit Courts of Appeal, respectively, applied Bostock’s definition to Title IX and struck down sex-specific bathroom policies in public schools. In Hecox v. Little, a district court in Idaho applied it to Title IX and women’s sports, and struck down a state law that preserved women’s sports for biological females. That case is now on appeal. Gorsuch’s attempt to limit Bostock to Title VII was ignored by those courts. One of the courts extending Bostock to Title IX said, “[t]here is no apparent reason why the Court’s conclusion … would remained cabined to Title VII and not extend to other statutes prohibiting sex discrimination.” Some cases have gone even further. In Clark County School District v. Bryan, the Supreme Court of Nevada not only applied Bostock to Title IX, it expanded “on the basis of sex” to include even “perceived sexual orientation.” A federal district court in Pennsylvania, meanwhile, extended the definition of sex to include “gender stereotyping.” Still other cases have applied Bostock to statutes and even regulations far afield from civil rights laws. In Whitman-Walker Clinic Inc. v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for example, the federal district court in the District of Columbia applied Bostock’s definition of sex to the Affordable Care Act through a circuitous route. The Affordable Care Act prohibits discrimination that would be prohibited by Title IX. It does not even mention Title VII. The judge in that case, however, concluded that Bostock’s reasoning clearly applied to Title IX, and therefore to the Affordable Care Act. Accordingly, the judge struck down a Health and Human Services rule interpreting the Affordable Care Act’s anti-discrimination provision as applying only to biological sex. A federal district court in Virginia even relied on Bostock to say that a gender-specific dress code could be challenged as unconstitutional sex discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The Court of Appeals of North Carolina did the same thing in the context of sexual orientation. President Joe Biden, ever eager to use executive action to advance progressive social causes, has joined in. Relying on Bostock, he issued an executive order directing executive branch agencies to reinterpret all the civil rights laws to interpret “sex” as Bostock does. Sweeping as Biden’s order is, the courts are on their way to making it irrelevant. If the courts keep up their trend of expanding Bostock outside the context of Title VII, then by the time Biden’s federal agencies promulgate their regulations, the courts may have already finished the job for him. All of this was predictable. Lower courts deal with more cases than the Supreme Court does, and those cases often differ in small ways from the limited precedents the Supreme Court hands down. What matters in those cases is not the ultimate holding of any Supreme Court case, but its reasoning. As those lower court decisions illustrate, Bostock’s reasoning can be applied—or at least is being applied—to other contexts. Of course, as a long-serving lawyer and judge, Gorsuch knew that. When he wrote that the court’s decision applied only to Title VII, he surely knew that that boundary was no sturdier than the paper it was printed on.

"], "text": "Abuse of any kind must be condemned and stopped wherever it is found. Sadly, two bills that are currently being considered in Congress—intended to prevent and treat child abuse and violence against women—will only further contribute to the abuse of children and women in America. How so? Consider the Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. The bill changes funding requirements to ensure that states who receive federal support for abuse-prevention integrate their efforts with organizations and individuals that have experience working with, and will maximize the participation of, “sexual and gender minority” children. Where vague language like “sexual and gender minority” or “sexual orientation and gender identity” has been included in local or state policy, those policies have been exploited by progressives to impose their transgender ideology as orthodoxy in medicine, counseling, and foster care and adoption. For example, in 2018, the city of Philadelphia’s sexual orientation and gender identity policies shut down Catholic Social Services for operating according to its religious belief that every child deserves a mother and a father. This bill could have the same kind of impact, but now with the support of federal law. By changing the federal funding requirements for abuse-prevention to now include “sexual and gender” minorities, the bill could pressure states that receive such assistance to make “gender-affirming” care the standard—for medicine, for counseling, for foster and adoption care, and for parents. In the medicine and counseling fields, this kind of care looks like encouraging and performing physical interventions—whether by means of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, or surgery—that affirm a person’s self-proclaimed gender identity. Such “care,” however, has recently been called out for what it is by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.: the surgical and chemical destruction of children’s genitalia. Thus, despite efforts from Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., and other House Republicans to remove this language, the Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act ironically makes children more vulnerable to abuse by those who support the surgical and chemical destruction of children’s genitalia. By pressuring states to accept “gender-affirming” care as normative, this could ultimately lead to state power creeping into homes to replace parents. Given its vague and undefined language, this legislation could be used by progressive activists to reinterpret what qualifies as abuse to include parents’ refusal of hormonal or physical interventions to “affirm” their child’s self-proclaimed gender identity. Should this happen, the state could step in to challenge parent’s rights to raise their children according to what they believe is best. This language could also be exploited by activists to redefine eligibility requirements for adoption or foster care. Parents looking to adopt or foster children struggling with gender identity may be deemed ineligible by placement agencies should they be hesitant to “affirm” that child’s self-proclaimed gender identity. Sadly, such tragic custody battles have already happened. In 2019, an Ohio judge removed a 17-year-old girl from her parents’ custody after they refused to allow doctors to help her “transition” with testosterone. By injecting Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act with sexual and gender identity language, the bill could lead to more cases like this. Just as with Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act , the sexual orientation and gender identity language in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act also undermines the safety of those it is meant to protect: women. Under federal law, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act would require women’s shelters to take in biological males who identify as women. These shelters help women to get away from their abusers, but the bill as it stands would embolden male predators to prey upon abused women, since they would be able to gain access by merely self-identifying as a woman. Additionally, the bill requires that female-only prisons admit biological males who identify as women. This leaves females in these prisons, whether inmate or employee, vulnerable to sexual predators. Just this week, an employee from a women’s correctional facility in Pierce County, Washington—a state that allows self-identifying transgender inmates to be housed in the prisons of their choosing—reported that an inmate transferred from a male facility raped a female on the day of his arrival. The transferred inmate, who had been incarcerated for sexual assault against multiple women and was even guilty of sexual assault against inmates at the male facility, was allowed to transfer simply by identifying as transgender. Two other trans-identifying biological males have also been transferred to that same women’s facility—both with histories of sexual assault. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act will make tragic incidents of abuse like this one only more common, not less. Ultimately, having been injected with progressives’ viewpoints of sex and gender, these two bills will only increase violence against women and child abuse.

Thirty-one states have introduced such legislation, and four of those—Arkansas, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Tennessee—have enacted sex-specific sports bills this year. The ACLU claims that preventing biological males who “identify” as female from competing in girls sports is not truly about sports, but rather “about erasing and excluding trans people from participation in all aspects of public life.” As so many other left-wing groups have, the ACLU has relied heavily on last year’s watershed Bostock v. Clayton County decision from the Supreme Court as providing the legal foundation to invalidate all attempts to secure Title IX’s protections for young women at the state level. That reliance is misplaced, and their lawsuits should fail. In Bostock, the Supreme Court expanded “sex discrimination” within the scope of employment discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and transgender status. The ruling set off a flurry of executive orders from the Biden administration, and had left-wing activists around the nation calling for whole-cloth modification of all federal laws where “sex discrimination” might be expanded to include sexual orientation and gender identity. Meanwhile, a Democrat-controlled Congress has reinvigorated its push to pass the Equality Act, which would accomplish by federal statute what the president has directed through executive fiat. However, in his opinion for the Bostock majority, Justice Neil Gorsuch began: “We proceed on the assumption that ‘sex’ signified what the employers suggest, referring only to biological distinctions between male and female.” That often overlooked, but critical, distinction is rarely a source of interest on the left. Biology was—at least prior to Bostock, and remains—the fulcrum upon which all “sex discrimination” distinctions in civil rights law turn. Instead, pundits skip straight to Bostock’s second-step analysis, where Gorsuch noted, “An individual’s homosexuality or transgender status is not relevant to employment decisions. That’s because it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.” Regardless of Gorsuch’s dubious “textualist” interpretation of federal anti-discrimination law, his opinion made clear: The court’s Bostock opinion supports the proposition that relying at least in part on an individual’s biological sex (as with the case of sexual orientation or transgender status) is prohibited within an employment setting. Title VII makes clear sex is irrelevant to employment decisions. But Title IX—the model for state legislation around the country designed to protect biological women within scholastic sports—differs significantly in its text, purpose, operation, and in certain applications from Title VII. While Title VII is “sex-prohibitive,” Title IX is “sex-affirmative,” and requires consideration of a student’s biological sex. During the waning days of the so-called sexual revolution, women and girls were still at an educational disadvantage when compared to their male peers. Title IX filled the gaps left by Titles VI and VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and was enacted to address the vast disparities women and girls experienced in relation to boys and men in all aspects of learning, from facilities to sports and beyond. Title IX has successfully changed the lives of girls and young women in America by broadening their educational horizons, which in turn has set them up for career success in later life. In high school athletics alone, the rate of girls’ participation in 2016 was more than 10 times what it was prior to Title IX’s passage in 1972—representing an increase of more than 1,000%. Title IX and its implementing regulations contain a set of limited, sex-affirmative exceptions. Those exceptions permit schools to take sex into account to address imbalances in admissions, academic programming, and sports. A sex binary—male vs. female—is the foundation upon which the entire statute’s operation rests. Title IX’s use of the words “both” and “either” to address educational disparities within its regulations reinforces the understanding that there are only two sexes, and opportunities for both must be equal under the law. Title IX requires educators to see women as they see men. And it ensures that girls and women, at long last, can finally experience sex equality in their educational pursuits. But with an onslaught of national efforts to gut the very mission and purpose of Title IX’s protective effects, it has fallen to the states to remind organizations like the ACLU that the law means exactly what it says it means. Recently criticized by the left-of-center New York Times for abrogating its free speech roots, the ACLU might do well to reevaluate the things it values and defends. Judging by its spate of lawsuits against states passing sex-specific sports bills, it appears biological women aren’t one of them. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal."},

It takes a swing at long-standing protections for religious liberty."], "text": "The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings Wednesday on the so-called Equality Act, a piece of legislation unparalleled in its hostility to religious liberty and that elevates sexual orientation and gender identity to protected-class status alongside race, sex, and national origin in the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Equality Act also expands the definition of “public accommodation” under federal law, and recipients of any federal funding—such as schools—would be directly affected by the act if it becomes law. It has already passed the House of Representatives. Plenty of ink has been spilled on the disastrous consequences the Equality Act would have on the administration of school sports, locker rooms, and bathrooms. But what of the curriculum the Equality Act might force schools to teach? Could it compel teachers to peddle unscientific notions that gender is “fluid,” or that a student’s subjective self-identity is superior to the biological reality of his or her chromosomal makeup? Unfortunately, due to some legal sleight of hand, the answer is very likely “yes.” As a general matter, the federal government is prohibited from meddling with school curriculums, something better left to local and state education associations as part of the 10th Amendment’s assurance that the powers not specifically delegated to the federal government are reserved to the states. The federal Department of Education Organization Act states: However, federal courts have recognized that in certain circumstances, federal involvement in education is warranted. To remedy past segregation, for example, some federal courts have required schools to remove educational materials considered racially biased, or to expand curricula to include black history. Both are reasonable means to meet the congressional goal of eliminating discrimination against blacks as articulated in the Civil Rights Act. Those cases stem from a body of law focused on “equity jurisdiction.” Under this principle, once the legal right of an individual (or class of individuals) and a violation of that right have been proven, a federal court’s power to remedy past wrongs is quite broad. It can include (and has included) changes to curriculums and teaching materials in order to eliminate both actual (“de facto”) and legal (“de jure”) segregation of school students. In United States v. School District 151 (1968), a federal district court concluded it had the power to decide all issues concerning alleged discrimination in public education, including school board policies, the allocation of faculty and staff, the location and construction of schools, the transportation of students, and the general educational structure and process. In order to remedy ongoing discrimination, another federal district court judge in Hoots v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (2000) “ordered that remedies for the constitutional violation proceed along several fronts … [and] ordered a comprehensive redesign of curriculum and testing, so that the curriculum would be appropriate for heterogeneous, multicultural, detracked classrooms and that the effectiveness of [the] redesigned curriculum would be carefully monitored through proper assessments.” While—thus far—federal courts have yet to flex their “equity” muscle within the context of LGBTQ students and rectifying ongoing discrimination, the Equality Act would amend Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to give sexual orientation and gender identity the same legal protections as immutable characteristics like race, sex, or national origin. Those have been historically recognized as nothing more than due to an accident of birth, and therefore deserving of heightened protection and stricter analysis. Now substitute the words “gender identity” for “race,” and there’s nothing to prevent a court from ordering the same kind of equitable remedy—curricular or otherwise—with respect to what a student might argue is a discriminatory educational setting. Neutral education policies don’t always cut it, either. In Adams v. United States (1980), the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sitting en banc held that a “racially neutral” assignment plan proposed by school authorities was inadequate, because it failed to “counteract the continuing effects of past school segregation.” Organizations such as the Human Rights Campaign have cleverly drawn unflinching parallels between LGBTQ and black youths, using the buzzwords of American jurisprudence on anti-discrimination law, likening the struggle of pre-Civil Rights Act segregated blacks to LGBTQ individuals who are themselves segregated and denied equal protection under the law. In so doing, they’ve teed up a post-Equality Act legal challenge for students whose educational environment isn’t sufficiently desegregated. (That is, it still teaches the “discriminatory” scientific notion that male and female are unchanging biological distinctions.) In a pre-Equality Act era, educational dissenters—who, like millions of Americans holding faiths that dictate a gender binary and heterosexual marriage as a societal ideal—would have had the right to object to forced action or offensive curriculum pursuant to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Indeed, Congress expressly applied the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to all federal law, statutory or otherwise, whether adopted before or after its enactment—including all laws governing education programs, such as Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and the Higher Education Act. However, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act contains a critical exception: It does not apply if the statute explicitly excludes its application. As is all too evident now, the Democratic drafters of the Equality Act took careful measures to make sure that under the bill, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act could not be used as a shield by the millions of individuals—whether teachers, students, parents, or school administrators—holding sincere objections of conscience based on their religious beliefs. How about religious schools? Surely, students in parochial schools won’t be subjected to dogma eliminating any recognition of male and female, right? Wrong again. The Equality Act could very well steamroll propaganda touting the political agenda of sexual orientation and gender identity advocates through the schoolhouse doors if the religious schools accept any funding under federal law. Take, for example, free and reduced-price lunch programs for low-income students, or admission of students on federally funded scholarships according to Title VI. Therein lies another Equality Act “gotcha.” Liberal University of Virginia law professor Douglas Laycock (in whose class I once sat) has recognized the breathlessly slim religious liberty exemptions that could still be maintained by religious schools post-Equality Act: Think a federalized sexual orientation and gender identity curriculum would be too hard to implement? Arne Duncan, secretary of education under President Barack Obama, used a carrot-and-stick funding approach to incentivize states to adopt the Common Core state standards and oversaw development of two testing consortia to assess whether uniform standards were being met. The result? Equivalent teaching geared toward the same outcomes across the country. The Equality Act doesn’t just rewrite the entire canon of American law on discrimination. It takes a swing at long-standing protections for religious liberty and local control of education. Just like the bully it is. This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal."},

This Is Unconstitutional.", "author": ["Sarah Parshall Perry", "Alex  Phipps"], "date": "Mar 24, 2021 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/school-districts-are-hiding-information-about-gender-transitioning-children-their", "takeaways": ["In Montgomery County, MD, educators are actively keeping information about something as critical as a student’s gender identity preference hidden from parents.", "Parents not only have the U.S. Constitution on their side, they have the protections of the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act as well.", "The Constitution and other federal law do not grant public school districts the authority to circumvent parental consent or notification in these matters."], "text": "American law has long recognized the importance of parental rights. A parent’s right to oversee the care, education, and control of their child  is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment, and confirmed by the Supreme Court in 1923, in Meyer v. Nebraska, and as recently as 2000, in Troxel v. Granville. To raise and educate a child as parents see fit is—and always has been—on a par with the other fundamental, constitutionally guaranteed rights. Worryingly, one school district in Maryland is acting like parental rights are no longer valid. In Montgomery County, Maryland, educators are actively keeping information about something as critical as a student’s gender identity preference hidden from parents—an action in direct contravention of legally guaranteed parental rights, and in violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. In response, two families have sued the Montgomery County Board of Education. The suit aims to enforce their rights to access information about their children’s the gender identity, which is generated and retained by Montgomery County schools pursuant to a 2019 policy. This policy enables Montgomery County Board of Education personnel to evaluate minors about sexual matters, allows minors of any age to transition socially to a different gender identity at school without parental notice or consent, and requires personnel to facilitate the transition with the use of the child’s “preferred pronouns.” It also permits students to use the restroom that aligns with their “gender identity,” stating that while “[s]ome students may feel uncomfortable with a transgender student using the same sex-specific facility,” that “discomfort is not a reason to deny access to the transgender student. School administrators and counseling staff members, the policy states, should work with students to “address their discomfort to foster understanding of gender identity and to create a school culture that respects and values all students.” Certainly, the parents of students made to share sex-specific spaces with students of the opposite sex would want to know this information. But the Montgomery County Board of Education policy forbids it. Stunningly, the policy prohibits personnel from communicating with parents on any of the above actions, and goes so far as to direct teachers and staff to deceive parents by reverting to a child’s birth name and corresponding pronouns whenever a child’s parents are present. According to court filings, the Montgomery County Board of Education claims it is acting in the best interests of the minors involved by protecting them from the “unsupportive” parents of those children. In its motion to dismiss, the Montgomery County Board of Education represented that disclosure to parents who are “not supportive… might expose the student to harm” and that “gender nonconforming students face significant dangers of abuse at home from unsupportive families.” The Montgomery County Board of Education policy requires that “the principal or identified staff member should speak with the student to ascertain the level of support the student either receives or anticipates receiving from home.” By cloaking critically important information about one’s child under the guise that unsupportive parents are “dangerous” to their children, schools are given license to effectively label “gender-critical” parents as abusive without the benefit of due process protections. Under some cock-eyed theory of “harm at home,” the Montgomery County Board of Education substitutes schools for parents, and deprives all parents in the county school system of their fundamental right to vital information based on nothing but a hunch. Montgomery County parents not only have the U.S. Constitution and the Maryland Constitution on their side, they have the protections of the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act as well. Specifically, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act gives parents of minors rights regarding their children’s education records, with the only exceptions being a court order or specific state law to the contrary. These rights include a right to access their children’s education records, to seek amendment of those education records, and to consent to disclosure of personally identifiable information. Parents whose Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act rights are violated can file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education (in addition to any private legal action). Montgomery County is not alone in bypassing parental consent and notification when it comes to students’ gender transitions. It’s quite possible the gender transition nightmare that Jay Keck experienced with his autistic daughter—facilitated and concealed by school officials in a Chicago suburb—could happen to other parents who are not informed of their rights. With full awareness of her mental health challenges, school officials helped Jay’s daughter socially transition by using her preferred pronouns, giving her access to a gender-neutral restroom, and keeping it all from her parents. When Jay and his wife discovered their child’s secondary identity and requested school officials treat her in accordance with her biological sex, they were continually defied. For proof of school districts’ increasingly cavalier attitudes toward parental rights, see the Metropolitan School District policy in Madison, Wisconsin, that requires staff to keep a student’s gender identity “confidential” from parents if the student does not consent to the information being shared. Or, see the New Jersey’s Department of Education’s guidelines, which instruct teachers how to avoid “inadvertently disclos[ing] the transgender student’s status” to parents. Or, see the guide on the Los Angeles Unified School District’s website which instructs teachers to provide whatever “services” they can for transitioning students with unsupportive parents. Even the National Education Association, a labor union for teachers across the nation, encourages teachers to hide a student’s gender identity from parents unless they are “required to [reveal it] by law.” While the public school districts and their unions may foolishly assume it knows better than parents about what to do when it comes to a child’s “gender identity,” the Constitution and other federal law do not grant them the authority to circumvent parental consent or notification in these matters. Despite the whims of the board of education, a parent’s rights do not end at the schoolhouse door. But if not eliminated, the unconscionable policy of the Montgomery County Board of Education will be the beginning of a steep and precipitous decline in protections for those rights.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., pulled back the curtain on the left’s promotion of “transgender medicine” by naming what it truly is: the “surgical destruction of [minors’] genitalia.” >>> Heritage Explains: The Equality Act in the Senate It is shocking that any U.S. president or presidential appointee would openly support the genital mutilation of American children under the guise of “medicine.” Thankfully, administrations come and go. But legislation can last lifetimes. Unlike the Biden administration, the Equality Act—which the Senate Judiciary Committee just held a hearing on—could normalize the destruction of children’s bodies and fertility for generations to come. One only has to look at our neighbors across the pond to get a glimpse of what such a world would look like. Since its passage of its own Equality Act in 2010—which expressly protects citizens seeking, in the process of, or having already undergone gender reassignment—the United Kingdom has seen a 1,460 percent increase in referrals of boys and a 5,337 percent increase in referrals of girls to the Tavistock and Portman Gender Identity Disorder Service, the country’s only gender clinic for children. >>> 4 Ways the Equality Act Would Harm Children In recent years, the destruction of minors’ genitalia under the guise of “transgender medicine” was at risk of becoming the norm. The standard “care” provided for these children involved the prescription of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones and even surgical interventions—so much so that the clinic was even accused of fast-tracking children into transitioning. Dr. David Bell, one of Tavistock’s doctors who reported these concerns, faced disciplinary action after speaking up. This led many others to resign. Since then, the High Court ruled this past December that minors under the age of sixteen would no longer be able to receive puberty-blocking drugs without approval from a judge. The court reasoned that minors under sixteen are too young to give informed consent to the drugs, which have life-altering and irreversible effects. During Dr. Levine’s hearing, Sen. Paul cited the girl represented in that very case: Keira Bell. After receiving testosterone and a double mastectomy without undergoing thorough evaluation, Ms. Bell now regrets her decision to “transition.” Born a female, Bell was a tomboy who grew up with divorced parents, was bullied in school, and struggled to make friends of either sex. She came to blame her struggles on the fact that she was born a girl. Around age fourteen, Bell turned to internet forums where she discovered the idea of transsexualism and was soon convinced that she, too, was a male born in female body. After three one-hour appointments without any resistance or questioning from doctors, the sixteen-year-old Bell received puberty blockers. After one year she was prescribed testosterone. And within four years of starting on puberty blockers, doctors removed her breasts. Not once did a health care professional ask her if she was sure she wanted to go through with the mastectomy. Not her counselors, not her doctors, not her surgeons. Sadly, Bell’s tragic story would be repeated over and over again in the lives of American girls and boys if the Equality Act becomes law. That’s not how the Left is selling the Equality Act. No, this Trojan horse is being advanced under the cloak of human rights. Yet it would devastate the mental, emotional, and physical heath of America’s children. By confusing and conflating disagreement on gender dysphoria with “discrimination” on the basis of gender identity, the Equality Act would politicize the treatment of gender dysphoria by punishing all those who dissent from the left’s gender ideology. Doctors, counselors, and parents who want to help children reconcile with their biological sex would be liable to punishment, all in the name of combatting “discrimination.” In fact, hospitals, medical doctors, and counselors would be forced to follow Dr. Levine’s advice on “transgender medicine.” This means that they could be sued for refusing to provide or perform “gender-affirming” interventions, like puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries. If the Equality Act is passed, doctors will be canceled by law, just as Dr. Allen Josephson was fired by Louisiana University and Dr. Paul McHugh, a doctor at John Hopkins, was targeted for a smear campaign after each expressed concerns about the lack of scientifically-proven health benefits of transition procedures. Hospitals, too, will come under fire, like Dignity Health medical center, for having policies that refuse to remove perfectly healthy sex organs in order to help a patient “transition.” Educators could be compelled to teach destructive ideas about gender identity to students as early as kindergarten, even though 66 percent of parents oppose it. Schools, private and public alike, would be pressured into allowing males to join female sports teams and to use locker rooms, showers, and bathrooms according to their self-professed gender identity. However, the Equality Act will wreak the most lasting damage not on doctors and counselors, by eliminating conscience protections and religious exemptions, but on children. The Equality Act will normalize the chemical and surgical destruction—or as Sen. Paul correctly identified, genital mutilation—of America’s children by politicizing care for gender dysphoria. Parents will lack alternatives apart from medical professionals who practice destructive transgender “medicine.” The cost of this ill-advised legislation will be paid by gender dysphoric children over the rest of their lifetimes, even though the bill’s proponents claim to be helping them. >>> 11 Myths About H.R. 5, the Equality Act of 2021 Given that nine times more Gen Z-ers identify as transgender than their Gen X or Baby Boomer parents, more children and teenagers like Ms. Bell are going to seek treatment for gender dysphoria. The Equality Act would make sure that no doctors or counselors could advise them to press pause until going through puberty, as Keira Bell wishes she had done. If the Equality Act is passed, children will be told that they can consent to irreversible changes to their bodies, and anyone who tries to stop them will be on the wrong side of the law. Never mind the science which shows that, among children who struggle with gender dysphoria, 88 percent of girls and 98 percent of boys will reconcile with their biological sex if allowed to go through puberty. Never mind the science which shows that those who undergo sex change interventions—by receiving puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, or surgeries—are permanently sterilized and experience no lasting benefits to mental health. By injecting transgender politics into civil rights law, the Equality Act endangers all American children. And the addition of religious exemptions, as in the “Fairness for All” bill, won’t be enough to protect them. The British put a stop to this madness by ruling to protect their children by law. Americans now have the chance to do the same for our children—by exposing the dark truth about the Equality Act before it becomes law."},

And yet, contrary to this pithy creed, any law that classifies gender identity as a protected class under civil rights law denies science. The Equality Act and the Fairness for All Act turn the scientific reality that there are only two sexes into the legal equivalent of racism. The Equality Act has turned civil rights law from a shield intended to protect racial minorities from discrimination into a sword that compels conformity to subjective viewpoints on sexual orientation and gender identity. These state- and local-level policies allow male athletes to compete against females in sports, even though studies show biological males retain a competitive advantage over females even after two years of taking estrogen. The Fairness for All Act drafters touted it as a reasonable compromise meant to mitigate the harms of the Equality Act. It includes religious exemptions and preserves the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which the Equality Act would nullify. However, this approach did not protect religious freedom in Utah, where legislators passed a similar compromise bill. Unsatisfied with the compromise, gender identity activists helped pass a ban on counseling that would have helped children struggling with gender dysphoria. The rule discriminates against counselors who seek to help patients reconcile with their biological sex and allows only gender-affirming counseling that supports chemical and surgical transition. These methods overlook the fact that 88% to 98% of those struggling with gender dysphoria will accept their biological sex after going through puberty, according to the fifth edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.” Enshrining the fundamentally flawed and radical idea that a person can change sex—at any age—as a civil right threatens the safety and freedom of all Americans, religious or not. The notion that a person can change his or her sex rejects science. This was on full display in the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearing on the Equality Act. During the hearing, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., asked Alphonso David, president of the Human Rights Campaign, “Are there more than two sexes, in your opinion?” David replied, “It’s not limited to two.” While David’s answer sent shockwaves through social media, it should not have come as a surprise. Gender identity advocates regularly insist that those who believe that there are only two sexes—male and female—overlook the science of intersex conditions. But David and other activists’ references to intersex people do not debunk the sexual binary. “Intersex conditions” or disorders in sexual development are statistical rarities occurring in approximately 1 out of every 5,000 births, according to Ryan Anderson’s research. Anderson’s Amazon-banned book, “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Movement,” states the medical community considers these atypical expressions of the sexual binary, not a third sex or the result of a third gonad. Because gender ideology flatly rejects science, enshrining it into federal law means no amount of religious liberty exemptions will prevent the damage caused by such policies like the Equality Act. Women and children—religious or not—will lose privacy, safety, and fairness in public and federally funded single-sex facilities and programs, which exist because of biological differences between men and women. Medical professionals—religious or not—who treat individuals struggling with gender dysphoria will lose the freedom to treat patients according to the best medical and scientific evidence. Normally, doctors and counselors correct a patient’s disordered perception of her body. Medical professionals also treat other body dysmorphias, like anorexia. Yet, the “gender affirmative” approach requires that they support a patient’s disordered perception of her body and even physically change its appearance to conform to the disorder. Laws that threaten the freedom of doctors and counselors harm struggling individuals. By reducing their options for care, these laws minimize patients’ chances to flourish in mind and body. Denying reality in the name of “gender-affirming care” causes harm, not healing. While the Fairness for All Act may protect doctors and counselors inside religious institutions, it will expose those in secular institutions to punishment. People may be free to adopt radical new ideas about gender for themselves, but if activists have their way and the Senate passes the Equality Act, the federal government will have power to pressure Americans into denying science under threat of punishment. Even good faith compromises like the Fairness for All Act suppress the freedoms of all gender identity dissenters outside of religious institutions. That is hardly fair at all. America is at its best when all citizens can seek and live according to the truth. Disagreements between gender identity advocates and Americans who know there are only two sexes will continue. Congress should allow them to, by rejecting the Equality Act and the Fairness for All Act that shut down any conversation. Most importantly, Congress should affirm that “science is real.” This piece originally appeared in The Daily Signal."},

Challenges Could Clear That Up.", "author": ["Sarah Parshall Perry"], "date": "Feb 19, 2021 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/bidens-executive-order-gender-discrimination-has-muddied-waters-title-ix", "takeaways": ["Title IX, as written, prohibits discrimination “on the basis of sex” in “any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.”", "What the “cancel culture” faction seems to have forgotten is that biological sex is still the foundation for anti-discrimination law.", "Codifying “sex,” by recognizing it as the biological and binary separation between males and females, would provide much-needed clarity for the females of today."], "text": "A month ago on Jan. 20, a newly minted President Joe Biden—who had remarked on Twitter during his presidential campaign, “Let’s be clear: Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time”—issued a lightning-fast executive order on the subject. Biden’s “Executive Order on Preventing and Combating Discrimination on the Basis of Gender Identity or Sexual Orientation” (EO 13988) directs the head of each federal agency to “review all existing orders, regulations, guidance documents, policies, programs, or other agency actions … that prohibit sex discrimination … [and] consider whether to revise, suspend, or rescind such agency actions, or promulgate new agency actions, as necessary to fully implement statutes that prohibit sex discrimination and the policy set forth in section 1 of this order.” Section 1 of that order references Bostock v. Clayton County, the landmark 2020 decision in which the Supreme Court held that Title VII’s prohibition of sex discrimination in the employment context also covers discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. But the order goes further, stating that “Under Bostock’s reasoning, laws that prohibit sex discrimination—including Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 … prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity or sexual orientation.” Title IX, as written, prohibits discrimination “on the basis of sex” in “any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.” Setting aside the blistering speed and volume of the nascent administration’s executive orders, and despite Biden’s previous statements that overuse of executive orders was the purview of dictators, EO 13988 is itself problematic for many reasons. Chief among them is its reliance on an expansive interpretation of Bostock that simply doesn’t pass muster when applied to Title IX. If anything, the White House order has significantly muddied the waters on the ongoing battle over the viability of women’s athletics, locker rooms, bathrooms, and other sex-segregated educational spaces. But the Department of Education’s engagement in the rulemaking process on Title IX would clear them up. As criticisms mounted over Biden’s aggressive fiat, USA Today’s “Fact Check” said that criticisms of the order lacked context, but it was nonetheless forced to admit that the executive order called for a “broader application of last year’s Supreme Court Bostock v. Clayton County ruling.” The far-left Human Rights Campaign called the executive order “wide-ranging.” And while not expressly tying an education institution’s federal funding to the participation of biologically male athletes who “identify” as women on female sports teams, the order fails to consider that recipients of federal education funding must certify their compliance with the nondiscrimination laws enforced by the Department of Education. Refusing to allow biological males to participate alongside females for athletic scholarships or on female sports teams would—under Biden’s expansive directive implemented by his Department of Education—constitute a violation of Title IX, thereby disqualifying said institution from receiving certain federal funds. Biden’s pick for Secretary of Education, Miguel Cardona, has already proclaimed his intentions to follow the order by doing away with sex-based distinctions in sports. Further complicating matters is the not insignificant fact that Justice Neil Gorsuch, in writing for the 6-3 majority in Bostock, went to great lengths to specifically avoid addressing Title IX and any related hypotheticals that might arise. He made clear that the court’s opinion was limited to the question of Title VII and employment discrimination alone, explicitly stating: “Under Title VII, too, we do not purport to address bathrooms, locker rooms, or anything else of the kind.” While Gorsuch rather cavalierly dismissed the far-ranging implication of the Bostock decision, thereby inviting future litigation on the issue, it remains the case that the court had the opportunity to swing for the fences on sex discrimination as “gender identity” discrimination in other federal laws—but demurred. In a timely effort to bypass an anticipated flurry of individual complaints, protracted investigations, and associated litigation on the issue of Title IX, the feminist Women’s Liberation Front (WoLF) issued a petition for rulemaking to the Department of Education on Feb. 8, in accordance with the Office of General Counsel’s procedures for requesting such rulemaking and guidance. Such rulemaking would force the Department of Education to correct the administration’s overly broad executive order, one that’s poised to sweep Title IX into a burgeoning body of bad law on gender identity without the benefit of judicial consideration. WoLF’s rulemaking petition requests that the department issue and amend Title IX regulations in order to comply with the executive order, while preserving the “legal permissibility of factually, objectively identifying people as males (boys and men) or females (girls and women) and … contin[ue] to distinguish between individuals on the basis of sex when such distinctions are important for ensuring equal opportunities for women and girls to flourish in education programs and activities.” What the “cancel culture” faction seems to have forgotten is that biological sex is still the foundation for anti-discrimination law. Quite simply, biological sex was not only the starting point for the majority’s analysis in Bostock, it was the linchpin of the Supreme Court’s entire decision. (“[T]he ordinary public meaning of the term ‘sex’ in Title VII means biological distinctions between male and female.”) The court’s inquiry centered on whether “but for” the petitioner’s biological sex, the outcome would have been same. (“If an employer would not have discharged an employee, but for that individual’s [biological] sex, [Title VII’s] causation standard is met, and liability may attach.”) Biological sex is also essential to the accurate interpretation and application of Title IX in American education, as the statute and its implementing regulations are written in such a way as to recognize sex as a binary choice—male and female (“for members of each sex”)—and go on to specify examples of sex-segregated activities, including athletics, intimate facilities, father-daughter and mother-son dances, and others. Either these activities and facilities can be separated by biological sex, or they must be sex-neutral and open to anyone for any reason. Doing that, of course, would vitiate 50 years of progress women have made toward sex parity in education. Gender identity cannot replace biological sex in federal law with the simple stroke of a presidential pen. Biden has made clear that he welcomes this cultural moment on the expansion of “gender identity” protections. He announced, for example, that he would appoint Rachel Levine, a transgender woman (biological man), to the post of assistant secretary for health and human services before he had even taken the oath of office. But his reactionary response vis-a-vis Executive Order 13988 has left girls and women in American schools abandoned in favor of platitudes on “respect” and “dignity.” What about those principles when girls are forced to share bathrooms with biological boys, or a young woman loses her track championship to someone with a biological advantage she will never possess? It will now be necessary to perform the long, difficult analysis required by the president’s attempted unilateral modification of long-standing federal law and to engage in a public comment period in order to clean up the mess the administration has made. Even then, the outcome of this process is far from clear. Codifying “sex,” by recognizing it as the biological and binary separation between males and females, would provide much-needed clarity for the females of today and their daughters of tomorrow. Failing to do so may well destroy the hard-won protections of Title IX that girls and young women have enjoyed for almost 50 years. If the president wants to show the women of this country that he truly values them, if protecting women is, as some have written, “part of his brand,” then he ought to direct his Department of Education to specify, once and for all, that Title IX means exactly what it says.

"], "text": "If you search the text of the Equality Act for the term “abortion,” you won’t find it. And while that might be by design, should the act ever become law, it would be disastrous for all Americans who care about protecting innocent unborn life. The House of Representatives is set to vote on this dangerous piece of legislation this week. In addition to being a Trojan Horse for abortion promotion, the Equality Act promotes inequality because it would penalize Americans for their beliefs about marriage and biological sex. The Equality Act would amend federal civil rights law by adding “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” as protected classes. In recent years, Heritage Foundation scholars have sounded the alarm about various groups that would be harmed should the act become law, including employers and employees, medical professionals, parents and children, women, and nonprofits and volunteers. The list doesn’t end there, and pro-life Americans should join the chorus of people rejecting this radical policy. >>> How Could Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) Laws Affect You? The Equality Act would have a devastating impact on a host of current pro-life policies and protections. It would lay the groundwork for eliminating prohibitions on taxpayer-funded abortions at the state and federal level; purge existing statutory conscience-protection provisions for pro-life individuals and entities in the context of health care; and nullify hard-fought court battles that upheld religious freedom protections for people and organizations, such as the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Catholic nuns that has spent nearly a decade in litigation over Obamacare’s onerous contraception mandate. How would the Equality Act accomplish these things, all of which have been highlighted as priorities by the abortion lobby? The Equality Act adds the term “sex” to Title II of the 1964 Civil Rights Act on public accommodations to mean pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions. Both the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals have interpreted “related medical condition” to include abortion. Because of the way the Equality Act is drafted, this new definition of sex discrimination—understood to include a medical condition such as abortion—would be applied to areas of law, such as federally assisted programs, public accommodations, and Obamacare’s nondiscrimination provision. In practice, it could mean that a health care provider would be discriminating on the basis of sex if they refused to perform an abortion procedure; a hospital could be discriminating on the basis of sex if it refused to allow abortions to take place within its facility; and health insurance plans could be discriminating on the basis of sex if they do not include coverage for elective abortions. The Equality Act specifically states that no claims for relief can be made under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which is the law that provided a pathway for groups such the Little Sisters of the Poor and businesses such as Hobby Lobby to receive relief at the Supreme Court from Obamacare’s onerous contraception mandate. According to the RFRA, the federal government cannot substantially burden the exercise of religion without demonstrating a compelling government interest that is accomplished through the least restrictive means possible. The Equality Act is explicitly clear that the legislation nullifies RFRA’s applicability. Equally disturbing is the Equality Act’s lack of any conscience protections for individuals with moral or religious objections. Federal law has, for more than 40 years, provided for various conscience-protection provisions for individuals and entities in the context of health care. Those laws protect, for example, a nurse from having to participate in an abortion procedure or certain health plans from covering elective abortions. Such protections ensure that individuals and entities are not compelled to participate in practices that violate their sincere moral, ethical, or religious convictions. The Equality Act ignores that proud tradition. The Equality Act could lead to changes in school curricula, such as texts that affirm and promote controversial sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) viewpoints. The Equality Act could also be used to override states that have prohibited SOGI curricula. Where states have conversely mandated SOGI curricula, parents and schools do not have access to “opt-out” options. Planned Parenthood, which has long been involved in exporting sex-education curricula in schools, has in recent years begun offering hormone treatments at some of its affiliate locations. If the Equality Act were to become federal law and public school curricula become further entwined with SOGI ideology, Planned Parenthood is well-positioned to further its presence in public schools and take advantage of an additional avenue to promote both SOGI ideology as well as the organization’s hormone-treatment services. In other words, additional SOGI curricula could become yet another marketing tool for America’s abortion giant. The Equality Act is bad policy and incorrectly considers disagreements about fundamental moral and religious beliefs to be discrimination. Should it become law, it would provide a basis to force taxpayers to pay for elective abortions, put an end to America’s proud tradition of protecting rights of conscience, and further the agenda of the abortion lobby at the expense of unborn children and Americans who care about protecting innocent unborn life.

{"title": "Biden’s Memo on LGBTQI Policies Abroad Is Ideological Colonialism", "author": ["Grace  Melton"], "date": "Feb 23, 2021 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/marriage-and-family/commentary/bidens-memo-lgbtqi-policies-abroad-ideological-colonialism", "takeaways": ["It will have potentially far-reaching consequences for religious liberty and freedom of conscience for American faith-based organizations.", "Many countries and religions, particularly in the developing world, view “gender ideology” as a form of ideological or cultural colonialism.", "A frequent result of this executive memorandum will be that these sorts of faith-based organizations will lose out on contracts with the U.S. government."], "text": "Earlier this month, President Joe Biden issued an executive order, “Memorandum on Advancing the Human Rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and Intersex Persons Around the World,” directing U.S. government entities to “pursue an end to violence and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or sex characteristics.” When we talk about human rights, it’s important to remember that every individual is entitled to his or her rights to life, freedom of belief, speech, and conscience. These are unalienable human rights. These rights are universal, precisely because they stem from our inherent human dignity, and are not a result of one’s membership in any particular group. Setting these rights on any foundation other than our shared humanity weakens the exercise of those rights rather than strengthens them. In fact, that is what Biden’s new memorandum threats to do. The administration’s directive for eradicating violence and discrimination is fraught with peril for the free exercise of religious belief, conscience, and speech. It illustrates the left’s prejudice against faith and tradition. This new executive order will have substantial impact on our foreign aid and diplomacy. It will have potentially far-reaching consequences for religious liberty and freedom of conscience for American faith-based organizations that operate around the world and for religious believers of all different creeds in other countries. To be clear, targeted violence on the basis of any characteristic is repellant and wrong. And the U.S. government should advocate for the protection of human rights and defend the victims of human rights abuses wherever and whenever possible. But this memo goes far beyond that. For example, it directs U.S. government agencies to expand efforts to combat “intolerance” and “discrimination” on the basis of LGBTQI+ status or conduct. These are expansive terms that beg definition. One primary target of these terms is the marriage laws of other countries. These laws are often influenced domestically by the prevailing religious traditions or cultural norms, and reflective of the democratic will of the people in those countries. American efforts to bully these countries—whether with a carrot of additional aid or a stick of withholding aid—into liberalizing their laws on marriage or other issues of sexual morality will surely cause friction with proponents of national sovereignty and religious believers alike, especially in Muslim- or Christian-majority countries. The distinction between disagreement and discrimination here is an important one. Take a familiar example from the United States: individuals from a variety of faiths, or no faith at all, can disagree about the meaning or purpose of marriage, or about the government’s proper role in encouraging marriage. These disagreements can and often do stem from different religious beliefs. The Supreme Court has addressed these conflicts between religious liberty and policies based on sexual orientation and gender identity in multiple cases now, confirming that disagreement—particularly disagreement rooted in religious belief—over whether two men or two women can or should marry is not the same as discrimination. As Justice John Kennedy wrote in his majority opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges, “the First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths…” He went on to state that individuals with conflicting beliefs about marriage “may engage those who disagree with their view in an open and searching debate.” Then what is discrimination? Certainly targeting, beating, or imprisoning somebody simply because he or she is gay or transgender is discrimination, just as it would be discrimination if someone was similarly abused on account of his or her race or religion or biological sex. However, is it discriminatory to set boundaries around the definition of marriage? No. There is no universal human right to the redefinition of marriage. Under the guise of promoting human rights, with this new executive memorandum the United States will instead be promoting an ideology about gender identity and sexual orientation that conflicts with internationally recognized rights. While Americans can look to the First Amendment to protect their religious freedom, so too can people around the world find similar religious freedom protections in both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which explicitly protect the freedom to manifest one’s beliefs in private and in public, individually, or in community. Regardless of popular opinion among liberal elites, human rights activists, or United Nation bureaucrats, the right to manifest one’s beliefs must also apply to those who maintain traditional beliefs about the creation of men and women, the definition and purpose of marriage, and the sanctity of life. Furthermore, the Charter of the United Nations commits to protecting “human rights and fundamental freedoms” for everyone “without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion.” But applying nondiscrimination standards on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity promotes the liberty and preferences of some at the expense of the freedom of religion, conscience, and expression of others.. Biden also calls for the U.S. to continue building coalition groups made up of members from like-minded nations, such as the U.N. LGBTI Core Group, and to engage international organizations in the fight against LGBTQI+ discrimination. This call to action will further embolden elements within the U.N. human rights bureaucracy that have been operating outside their mandates. These bureaucrats have been reading rights based on sexual orientation and gender identity into “gender” language in human rights treaties, and creating new rights that UN member states have not agreed to and that remain sensitive and controversial. As Li-ann Thio, professor of law and former member of parliament from Singapore, recently wrote in a comprehensive report on equality and nondiscrimination in international human rights law, The LGBTQI+ agenda and policies are not universally popular around the world. Many countries and religions, particularly in the developing world, view “gender ideology” as a form of ideological or cultural colonialism that specifically threatens their religious values. Yes, the U.S. can and should stand up for everyone’s human rights. But existing legal instruments are in place to do that, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. What the U.S. should not do is violate the internationally protected rights to freedom of religion or belief. Cardinal Robert Sarah of Guinea has warned that “the violence against Christians is not just physical, it is also political, ideological, and cultural.” During President Barack Obama’s 2015 visit to Kenya, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta publicly repudiated American efforts to impose western values on Africa, saying: Finally, the memorandum requires all U.S. agencies engaged abroad—specifically, but not limited to, the Departments of State, Treasury, Defense, Justice, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Development Finance Corporation, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Export-Import Bank, and the Office of the United States Trade Representative—to compile and submit reports annually on their progress in advancing initiatives on behalf of LGBTQI+ rights. These government progress reports will likely catalog a number of example of censorship and violations of conscience rights of those with earnestly held religious beliefs. Religious belief motivates an enormous amount of charitable and humanitarian work here in the U.S. and abroad. Faith-based organizations are leaders in the nonprofit sector around the globe, and other partner with USAID or other government entities to deliver aid. For example, groups as diverse as Catholic Relief Services, Islamic Relief USA, and the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee have operations that serve communities across the developing world. All of them adhere to religious codes that reject many elements of the progressive LGBTQI+ agenda. Nevertheless, these and other faith-based organizations are known for serving individuals of different creeds or no faith at all, and they deliver much-needed assistance all over the world. It’s not hard to imagine that a frequent result of this executive memorandum will be that these sorts of faith-based organizations will lose out on contracts with the U.S. government if they fail to repudiate their religious beliefs about marriage or sexuality.\n\nRecall, for example, the recent case of the evangelical organization Samaritan’s Purse that set up field hospitals in Central Park last year to treat patients at the height of the coronavirus pandemic in New York. They welcomed everyone in need, and yet the organization was still pilloried as homophobic because of its adherence to traditional views of marriage. The United States can and should champion the human rights of individuals who identify as LGBTQI+ by adhering to our American principles, honoring existing international treaties, and encouraging other countries to do the same without penalizing them for rejecting an ideological agenda. An executive action designed to advance the special interests of a particular group under the guise of human rights will unnecessarily risk religious freedom at home and abroad.

The left praised this achievement with slogans such as “We will not be silenced.” Time magazine dedicated its Person of the Year issue in 2017 to “The Silence Breakers” to honor the women who spoke up against their abusers. But today, the left does not seem to want to condemn the abuse and silencing of women taking place in women’s sports. President Joe Biden’s transgender executive order and legislation such as the Equality Act, if passed, would require the unqualified inclusion of biological males who identify as women in women’s sports. In so doing, the left actively subjugates women to abuse and silences them under the guise of “inclusivity.” Although biological males hold unfair advantages in noncontact sports, such as track and field, forcing women to compete against biological men in contact sports approaches abuse. In mixed martial arts, Fallon Fox, who “transitioned” from male to female at 30 years old, is the first openly transgender athlete to compete as a woman despite the dangers of injury to other competitors. In September 2014, Fox fought Tamikka Brents. Within the first two minutes of the match, Fox had fractured Brents’ skull and gave her a concussion. Fox continued the brutal assault until Brents was knocked out. “I have struggled with many women and I have never felt the strength I felt in a fight like that night,” Brents said later. “I have never felt so dominated in my life and … I am an abnormally strong woman in my own right.” In any other instance, the domination of a woman by a biological male would make her a victim of abuse and injustice, according to the left. But because Brents was a woman fighting a trans-identifying biological male, the left dismissed her as a sore loser. Vice’s article on the story criticized Brents for not being inclusive and told her to “get over it” and accept that “Fallon Fox is a woman.” It is absurd and wrong for even one woman to be dismissed for being brutally assaulted by a biological male in a dangerously unfair competition. It is worse when women are told to put up with this kind of assault without any recourse or redress from the institutions meant to protect them. Yet, that’s exactly what is happening today. Today, the NCAA silences its own female athletes to conform to the left’s gender identity ideology. In its “Transgender Handbook,” the NCAA dismisses the fears of those who want to protect women’s sports as “not well founded.” Instead, athletic departments and personnel are encouraged to create “an inclusive and non-discriminatory climate” for their teams. The handbook claims the “assumption that a transgender woman competing on a women’s team would have a competitive advantage outside the range of performance and competitive advantage or disadvantage that already exists among female athletes is not supported by evidence.” But it fails to cite its evidence. In fact, its claims are contrary to the evidence. A recent study by the British Journal of Medicine shows that male athletes who are “transitioning” retain their competitive edge against women even after two years of taking estrogen. Currently, trans-identifying biological males can compete on women’s teams in the NCAA and Olympics after only one year of being on estrogen. Ultimately, no amount of cross-sex hormones is enough to undo the fundamental biological differences that exist between males and females. In light of this study, NCAA’s publication of a “Transgender Handbook” that fails to cite any evidence of its claims and even makes claims contrary to scientific evidence can be explained only as an ideologically driven attempt to silence women in the name of inclusivity. A growing number of women on both sides of the political spectrum are getting fed up. Last August, 309 women wrote a letter to the NCAA urging it to consider the biological realities, the physical dangers of having men compete against them, and the implications for fairness in competition. More recently, the Women’s Liberation Front, a radical feminist group dedicated to supporting the basic rights of all women and girls, submitted a petition to the Department of Education challenging Biden’s recent executive order and the threat it poses to Title IX protections for women. Other Americans are rallying around the Promise to America’s Children, which is dedicated to protecting children from the harms of destructive gender ideology as well as the equality and safety of girls and women’s sports. If the hard-won equality and rights of women are to be preserved, women once again must speak up about injustice and challenge the unfair consequences of dissenting from an ideology that seeks to eradicate the very concept of women in sports.

Gloucester County School Board—an appeal from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals over a biological girl’s access to the boy’s bathroom in one Virginia school district. In so doing, it hands a victory to the former student, Gavin Grimm; establishes a bad precedent on the ability of students in federally funded schools to use the bathroom of their choosing; and misses a chance to clarify Title IX. The denial was a bit of déjà vu for the Supreme Court. Grimm’s campaign for bathroom access began in 2015. After a win at the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, the justices in 2017 remanded the same student’s case to the 4th Circuit to interpret Title IX in light of the Trump administration’s withdrawal of a federal guidance that had previously permitted mixed-sex bathroom use in schools receiving federal funds. In that previous appeal, the lower court had relied on an interpretation of federal law by the Obama administration’s Education Department, which determined that transgender students could use the bathroom of their choice. It had not, however, reached a substantive conclusion on whether that interpretation was correct. The Supreme Court’s denial of review cements a substantive win for Grimm. The 4th Circuit held in 2020 that Title IX and the equal protection clause required the school district to allow Grimm, a biological girl, to use the boy’s bathroom. Even the school’s provision of a separate, sex-neutral bathroom for Grimm was considered insufficient to protect Grimm’s legal interests. Two of the court’s arch conservatives, Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, dissented and would have granted review. Perhaps they rightly recognized a lost opportunity to bring clarity to Title IX’s current patchwork of competing schemes and interpretive guidance. States, the Biden administration, individual school districts, and the courts have all taken varying approaches in response to President Joe Biden’s executive order of Jan. 20, which directs all federal agencies to include sexual orientation and gender identity within the interpretation and application of the anti-discrimination laws enforced by their respective agencies. This may not be the only time the Supreme Court has a chance to review what is required by Title IX’s provisions, though, as another Title IX lawsuit challenging sex-segregated athletics is currently pending in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, after being dismissed by a federal trial judge who made clear his political preferences on the transgender issue. In addition, a school district’s petition for the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to rehear yet another school bathroom case is currently pending. Should either the 2nd or 11th circuits take a textualist approach to Title IX, the conflicting interpretations would set up another opportunity for the Supreme Court to clarify whether its glib expansion last term of “sex” in anti-discrimination employment law in Bostock v. Clayton County to include sexual orientation and gender identity applies to other anti-discrimination statutes. Indeed, in the Bostock v. Clayton County opinion itself, Justice Neil Gorsuch, writing for the majority, clearly stated that the ruling on Title VII’s expansion of “sex discrimination” to include sexual orientation and transgender status should not be construed as automatically applying to other federal civil rights laws: The recent guidance issued by the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights makes clear that at least until a change in administration or the Supreme Court’s review of the issue, Title IX’s prohibition on sex discrimination in educational institutions that receive federal funding will be interpreted to mean discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, too. However, both the president’s January executive order and the Department of Education’s recent guidance remain silent on potential enforcement actions the agency might take against institutions that don’t comply. Schools should anticipate future guidance from the Education Department on how to comply with its new Title IX interpretation—and what the consequences of noncompliance might be. While religious schools will continue to enjoy a religious exemption granted to them by the implementing regulations of Title IX, that, too is currently being challenged in court, with a class of students at religious institutions claiming that Title IX’s religious exemption is unconstitutional as a violation of their right to equal protection.

But in the wake of his sweeping Executive Order on gender identity and sexual orientation protections, his aggressive moves on abortion, and the appointments of particular cabinet officials, his expressions of faith ring particularly hollow. But while the dispatches from President Biden’s left-bent Washington have been disconcerting in these past few weeks, the Equality Act—and Biden’s ardent promise to get it enacted it in his first 100 days—would surpass them all. The Senate did not take up the bill after it passed in the House in May 2019. But with Democrats in control of both chambers and the White House, the bill is more likely than ever to become law. Perceiving the wind at their backs post-Bostock v. Clayton County (last year’s U.S. Supreme Court case that forbids employer-based discrimination on account of gender), the Human Rights Campaign trumpeted the Equality Act’s likelihood of passage barely days after the page had turned on the 2021 calendar, though even more moderate Senators have expressed reservations about the bill. >>> 11 Myths About H.R. 5, the Equality Act of 2021 Just how ambitious is the Equality Act? It makes a stunning fifty-nine substantive changes to longstanding federal laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Government Employee Rights Act of 1991, the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, the Fair Housing Act, the Civil Rights Act of 1968, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and even the Jury Selection & Services Act. These are laws addressing public education, public accommodations, public facilities, housing, employment, federal grants and loans, how juries are selected, and transactions involving credit. The Act adds “sex” to some titles like “public accommodations,” and adds “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” in nearly all federal law, while also greatly expanding the scope of public accommodations. Originally and narrowly limited to restaurants, hotels, theaters, and other establishments (a function of efforts to prevent the rejection of racial minorities in public places during the dark days of segregation), the definition of public accommodation under the Act would be unilaterally expanded to include “any establishment that provides a good, service, or program.” And it would include “a store, shopping center, online retailer or service provider, salon, bank, gas station, food bank, service or care center, shelter, travel agency, or funeral parlor, or establishment that provides health care, accounting, or legal services.” Particularly targeted by this sweeping bill are (1) biological women, (2) religious Americans, and (3) parents. If you happen to be a religiously observant  biological woman who is also a parent  (as I am), this bill portends the assassination of not only what you believe, but who you are, and what your children learn. Think the Equality Act won’t affect you? Think that “equality” sounds anodyne enough? After all, Americans don’t want discrimination against anyone—LGBTQ or otherwise. Everyone should be able to enjoy the blessings and benefits of liberty secured to Americans by the U.S. constitutional republic, yes. The beauty of the United States is that it is unparalleled in the freedom it affords its citizens. But it’s for precisely this reason that Americans don’t want the poison that the Equality Act proffers: forced speech, coerced action, biased curricula, junk science, and the gutting of protections for religious beliefs. Every American should be very concerned. Perhaps Democratic leaders digesting the mounting opposition to the Equality Act would do well to understand what Americans don’t want. Americans don’t want their rights of conscience and free exercise eviscerated. But under the Act, Christian bakers would no longer be able to abstain from producing messaging and materials contrary with the Bible’s view of marriage, which the Act refers to as a “sex stereotype.” Catholic foster agencies could not choose only married, heterosexual parents as foster parents in line with Catholic teaching. The Equality Act decimates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA)’s effect in operation of any of the above laws, with the text explicitly specifying: “The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 2000bb et seq.) shall not provide a claim concerning, or a defense to a claim under, a covered title, or provide a basis for challenging the application or enforcement of a covered title.” With no conscience protections whatsoever, the Equality Act would have dictated opposite outcomes for both the Little Sisters of the Poor and Hobby Lobby at the Supreme Court when they sought relief from the burdensome contraception mandates of Obamacare. Americans don’t want their children indoctrinated with the belief that biology is fungible and can be manipulated for partisan purposes. Nor do Americans want to be fed universal Marxist dicta on how religious folks are bigots. But under the Act, all educational institutions—yes, even religious ones—would be subject to “gender identity” protections in sports, bathrooms, and sex ed, among others. And while the federal government usually eschews involvement in curricular matters, the regulatory overlords of this administration could (through the federal courts or by tying federal funding to the adoption of uniform curricular “standards,” the way Obama’s Department of Education did with Common Core) impose a nationwide mandate to incorporate sexual orientation and gender identity into the curriculum in all public schools. Americans don’t want their daughters or their mothers sharing private spaces, sports teams, or shelters with biological men who “identity” as female. Americans are aware of the fact that settled science recognizes principles of incontrovertible biology and a sex binary, and no one is born in the “wrong” body. Yet, under the Equality Act, the neighborhood shopping mall would become a public accommodation, with gender-neutral bathrooms open to all. Girls’ track teams and girls’ athletic scholarships would be open to biological males. Employers, charities, and medical providers would be forced to pay for or perform sex-reassignment surgeries. And biological men would be admitted to female-only battered women or homeless shelters. >>> Promise to America’s Children Warns of Destructive Equality Act LGBT Agenda Civil rights legislation that establishes a hierarchy of rights, a super-protected class of individuals, or elevates sexual politics over first and foundational principles must be defeated. The Equality Act is a papered contradiction, demonstrating just how unequal religious, or female, or dissenting Americans are. It is a blueprint for fast-tracking a constitutional republic toward socialism. Every American should be very concerned. That the bill boasts 223 Democrat co-sponsors in the House (and no Republicans) indicates just how partisan it is. That the bill states, “Women also have faced discrimination…including sexual harassment, differential pricing for substantially similar products and services, and denial of services because they are pregnant or breastfeeding”—and yet includes within its protections men who identify as women, who cannot breastfeed and cannot get pregnant—indicates just how out of touch the bill is. That the bill guts faith-based protections for religious Americans, those who subscribe to a Judeo-Christian ethic that dictates a sex binary, recognizes the value of unborn lives, or establishes marriage as one man and one woman indicates just how hostile the bill is to religiously observant Americans. The Equality Act imposes nationalized group-think, and worse, group-act. Americans of sound thinking who value the principles of liberty and conscience on which their nation was founded should oppose it. The next generation is counting on it."},

Planned Parenthood’s focus on federal policy is not surprising given the significant investment it routinely makes during election cycles. And while those efforts make headlines, the data and information in annual reports deserve scrutiny and analysis as well. The medical and financial data provides a revealing display of the organization’s priorities. Medical data in the 2019-20 annual report actually covers the period from Oct. 1, 2018, to Sept. 30, 2019. Planned Parenthood reported: Financial data in the 2019-20 annual report covers the period from July 1, 2019, to June 30, 2020. Planned Parenthood reported: The Charlotte Lozier Institute notes that over the last decade, Planned Parenthood performed roughly 129 abortions for every adoption referral. The institute—which is the research arm of Susan B. Anthony List, a pro-life organization—also highlights that in the last decade, cancer screening and prevention services have decreased 63%, prenatal services have decreased 79%, and the number of unique patients has decreased 20%. Planned Parenthood’s annual report also highlights its work in other areas, such as standing with the “Defund the Police” movement and efforts to oppose other Trump administration priorities, such as judicial nominations and policies related to immigration law. In the 2019-20 annual report, Planned Parenthood reports that it operates “more than 200 health centers in 31 states providing hormone therapy for transgender patients.” In the previous annual report, Planned Parenthood listed 31 states but didn’t say how many clinics. As of February 2021, the Planned Parenthood website lists clinics in 33 states as well as the District of Columbia as places people may seek cross-sex hormones to “affirm gender identity.” As previously reported at the Daily Signal, Planned Parenthood is one of the nationwide leaders in providing such services. Abigail Shrier, author of “Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters,” recently wrote about Planned Parenthood’s increasing footprint in the transgender space based on a first-hand account of a former “reproductive health assistant.” The former clinic worker said that “trans identifying kids are cash cows, and they are kept on the hook for the foreseeable future in terms of follow-up appointments, bloodwork, meetings, etc., whereas abortions are (hopefully) a one-and-done situation.” Shrier’s piece concludes: Planned Parenthood’s annual reports have long provided the pro-life movement with an opportunity to analyze the organization’s latest medical and financial data. It’s clear that Planned Parenthood has staked a claim in yet another controversial area of services, and going forward, the organization’s involvement in the gender identity space merits closer scrutiny.

Rand Paul was also right to point out the left’s double standard when it comes to approved medicine. ", "The hearing is just further proof that Levine and transgender advocates are driven more by ideology than evidence."], "text": "The left will stop at nothing to impose destructive gender ideology on our nation. So far, President Joe Biden has issued a radical transgender executive order and the Democrat-controlled House just passed the Equality Act—the goal of which is to establish transgender ideology as the new orthodoxy of our day. It seems his nominee for U.S. health and human services assistant secretary, Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine, plans to advance this ideology even further. Levine’s qualifications have already been questioned. But on Thursday, Levine’s real lack of qualifications was exposed by a question from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., during Levine’s hearing. Paul, a licensed ophthalmologist, exposed and decried the “surgical destruction of [minors’] genitalia” taking place in the name of “transgender medicine,” which Levine openly supports. He further noted that hormonal interventions, such as puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, are just as destructive since they permanently alter the body and cause sterilization. Paul is right to make the comparison between genital mutilation and “transgender care” for minors. In any other case, the physical destruction of a minor’s genitalia as a result of social pressures to conform and be accepted by others would be condemned as genital mutilation. Indeed, this is the description of genital mutilation, according to the World Health Organization. Inflicting such irreversible harm to children’s bodies should be condemned for what it is. When asked point blank whether minors are capable of making—and should be allowed to make—life-altering decisions to change one’s sex with the support of government intervention if necessary, Levine refused to answer. “Transgender medicine is a very complex and nuanced field, with robust research and standards of care that have been developed,” Levine evaded. But it’s not complex. The standards of care Levine recommends are highly controversial and disputed. The science shows that among children who struggle with gender dysphoria, 80% of girls and 95% of boys will reconcile with their biological sex if they are allowed to go through puberty. >>> 11 Myths About H.R. 5, the Equality Act of 2021 Moreover, those who undergo sex-change interventions do not experience lasting benefits with regards to mental health. In fact, they are 19 times more likely to commit suicide. Additionally, besides sterilization, puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones have been shown to damage cardiovascular health, bone density, and reproductive functions. Paul was also right to point out the left’s double standard when it comes to approved medicine. Democrats refused to entertain COVID-19 treatments that lacked approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, but they seem to have no hesitation about injecting America’s children full of life-altering drugs that are not FDA-approved for treatment of gender dysphoria. In the end, Levine’s answer demonstrates an unwillingness to engage in a discussion about the scientific reality of “transgender medicine.” It also demonstrates a serious lack of concern about the life-long harm it can cause children. The hearing is just further proof that Levine and transgender advocates are driven more by ideology than evidence. In the coming days—especially since the Equality Act has passed the House and been introduced in the Senate—there will be increasing pressure for conservatives to soften their public stances on gender ideology with more politically correct messaging and legislation. Paul’s exchange with Levine should be a reminder that real compassion is incompatible with any compromise that would leave medical doctors, parents, and children vulnerable to the gross violation of human rights that is genital mutilation.

This is where we will be headed if radical progressives have their way."], "text": "Public education, the Presbyterian scholar and pastor J. Gresham Machen once wrote, is one of the greatest achievements of the modern era. And yet, he warned, \"when once it becomes monopolistic, it is the most perfect instrument of tyranny which has yet been devised.\" Something similar could be said of Big Tech companies and online retailers such as Amazon. Truly, Amazon is a miracle of modern society: same-day delivery, instant streaming, and an endless selection of just about anything one could want. But when the world’s largest online retailer makes itself the arbiter of a new cultural orthodoxy, as it has done in recent days, it quickly becomes one of the most insidious instruments for, yes, tyranny. Just a few days before the House vote on the Equality Act, which enshrines gender identity into civil rights law as a protected class, Amazon decided it would no longer sell Ryan T. Anderson’s book When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment, which has been sold on the site since its release in 2019. This decision goes well beyond one book. >>> The Equality Act Would Unleash Destruction on America’s Children In addition to being the world’s largest online retailer, Amazon is currently the United States's largest book retailer, providing 53% of all books sold and 80% of all e-books sold. As Abigail Shrier, author of Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing our Daughters, has pointed out, Amazon’s censorship has far-reaching impacts for the publishing industry: \"As a direct result of Amazon’s action, many outstanding books will now go unwritten; they will not be commissioned whenever Amazon’s distribution is the slightest bit in doubt.\" The reasoning of the new, self-appointed arbiter of cultural orthodoxy is rife with contradictions. Amazon said it removed Anderson’s book because it violates its \"Content Guidelines for Books\" by framing \"LGBTQ+ identity as mental illness.\" This excuse is used despite the fact that such a statement cannot be found in the book. Moreover, Amazon still sells the fifth edition of the American Psychological Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which explicitly describes gender dysphoria as a mental illness. This double standard reveals that Amazon’s recent actions are ideologically driven. More alarmingly, these recent events reflect the beginning stages of a widespread erosion of freedom of conscience and speech. The erosion of freedom has historically occurred through four types of punishments that get progressively worse in stages. The first is the social marginalization of unpopular or minority views. The second is economic disenfranchisement. The third is legal sanctions, including criminalization. And the fourth is violence. Amazon’s recent censorship corresponds to the first two stages of this erosion. Mainstream science-based and conservative views on sex, gender, marriage, and embodiment are dubbed \"fringe\" or dismissed as irrational phobias. Rather than engaging with sincere questions about whether irreversible genital mutilation and radical chemical intervention are moral and medical best practices, especially for children, liberal ideologues simply ostracize dissenters as not \"woke\" enough. >>> Parental Rights, Gender Ideology, and the Equality Act But those who hold these views are not just ostracized. Amazon’s refusal to sell books similar to Anderson’s goes one step further and takes us into the second stage of freedom erosion by economically disenfranchising those who hold views that Amazon opposes. They are not simply marginalized in society. They are refused basic participation in the market exchange. This disincentivizes writers who can no longer sell their writings and discourages those interested in reading their writings. Sadly, we are on the precipice of the third stage: legal penalties, including criminalization. The Equality Act would make all who disagree with Amazon and other liberal gender ideological constructs liable to charges of discrimination. Such a move from the Left would make anyone who dissents from its destructive gender ideology an outlaw. In the past, freedom of thought and speech were valued, pursued, and protected with arduous effort because our forebears had seen the shedding of blood to enforce religious orthodoxies. The U.S. was founded on the promise that the government could not establish a religious orthodoxy. But now, we stand on the precipice of Congress enshrining a secular orthodoxy on gender and sex into law. The alternative to freedom and peaceful pluralism is persecution. This is where we will be headed if radical progressives have their way."},

That’s what CBS’ “60 Minutes” is famous for and why its viewers rely upon it. To its credit, “60 Minutes+” (the new spinoff that runs on the Paramount+ streaming service) did approach The Heritage Foundation to seek our perspective on the Save Adolescents From Experimentation (SAFE) Act, an Arkansas bill that bans the sterilization of gender-dysphoric children through experimental use of hormones and surgeries. But, in its coverage surrounding treatment of children with gender dysphoria, “60 Minutes+” only interviewed parents on one side of the transgender debate, those who affirm transgender ideology and the model of “gender-affirming care.” “60 Minutes+” ignored the perspectives of those who caution against the “transing” of kids, because of the long-term harm to their mental and physical health. In my hourlong interview with them, I recommended that these alternative perspectives be included and gave the show’s producers contact information of people who were willing to speak on camera. >>> New Documentary Highlights the Harm of “Gender Affirming” Health Care Model on Children Here’s what (and who) “60 Minutes+” didn’t show you: 1. Kids who “detransitioned” and desisted because their underlying distress was not relieved by hormones and surgeries. Much of the piece focused on the story of Dylan, a 15-year-old girl who “identifies” as a boy, takes testosterone, and finds it helpful. During the interview, I told “60 Minutes+” correspondent Seth Doane that the United Kingdom had banned hormones to treat children under 16 for gender dysphoria based on the finding that they are not capable of giving informed consent. The moral and legal premise of informed consent is that a patient has the right to make decisions about his or her own health. The ability to give informed consent is premised on one’s capacity to understand the potential consequences of a treatment, including both benefits and risks. Because children and adolescents have not developed the full emotional and intellectual capacity of adults, Britain found that its national gender clinic (like the more than 60 that have sprung up in America) violated that ethical principle when administering puberty blockers to Keira Bell at the age of 16 because she was too young to understand the consequences. Bell also had a double mastectomy at age 20 and now regrets transitioning. She was left with “no breasts, a deep voice, body hair, a beard, [and] affected sexual function” and worries she may be infertile as a side effect of the drugs. Bell sued the clinic. “I look back with a lot of sadness. There was nothing wrong with my body. I was just lost and without proper support,” she said. “Transition gave me the facility to hide from myself even more than before. It was a temporary fix, if that.” Because of the U.K.’s finding, the Finnish government has recognized that children should go through a period of “watchful waiting,” rather than being rushed into treatments with irreversible side effects. Sweden’s leading hospital has followed suit. When the reporter described the number of “detransitioners” as minuscule, I told him that Walt Heyer, a man who lived as a woman for eight years, has collected the stories of detransitioners around the world and estimates that 20% experience “sex-change regret,” but they chose not to include that data. Shortly before the “60 Minutes+” interview, the traditional Sunday night version of “60 Minutes” ran a story in which correspondent Lesley Stahl interviewed 30 “detransitioners,” including one who said he became suicidal for the first time after surgery on his genitals. There was intense backlash from the Human Rights Campaign and other LGBT activists against “60 Minutes” for including the voices of those who have become skeptical about “gender affirmation.” 2. Parents who don’t want their children to be transitioned, but are ignored by counselors and doctors. The “60 Minutes+” piece featured two mothers of transgender-identifying kids who want their children to continue receiving experimental hormones. Although we gave the producers contact information for parents who want their children to accept their bodies, they declined to interview them. You can see their stories in the new documentary film “TransMission: What’s the Rush to Reassign Gender?” As one mom in the movie named Brynne recounts, “The pediatrician said if I didn’t affirm my daughter’s identity, and I didn’t get her the help that she needed, and she killed herself, I was going to feel awfully guilty—right in front of my daughter.” Other parents of gender-dysphoric children are rallying together in groups such as Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria Kids and Fourth Wave Now. They try to stop counselors, school officials, and doctors from pushing their kids into extreme treatments that will rob them of their physical and emotional health and leave them unable to have families of their own. Their stories are also told in Abigail Shrier’s book “Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters,” which we gave to the producers of the show. The mainstream media have largely shut out the voices of these parents, because they don’t fit the narrative that hormones are miracle drugs for kids who are uncomfortable with their bodies. 3. Doctors who question the efficacy of the transgender movement’s recommendations and warn of the long-term dangers to children. The “60 Minutes+” report highlighted the recommendations of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health that children receive hormones and, in some cases, surgeries. Yet the World Professional Association for Transgender Health is not an association of medical professionals. It’s an association of professionals in fields, including anthropology and sexology, that seeks to influence standards of care in medicine. The influence of money and politics that led to the reclassification of gender dysphoria in the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders” is documented in the book “Sexual Minorities and Politics” by pro-LGBT author Jason Pierceson. The manual previously described the condition as “gender-identity disorder,” then renamed it “gender dysphoria,” and now only categorizes the anxiety associated with the condition as a mental disorder. A growing number of actual doctors in the U.S. and overseas are questioning why there is such a sudden rise in the number of children who “identify” as transgender. The recent surge in the number of children expressing gender dysphoria even caused the doctors who created the “Dutch Protocol” of puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries to question its use on young patients with gender dysphoria. Patients who are treated with puberty blockers for “precocious puberty” (the premature onset of puberty) have reported side effects that include degenerative disc disease and fibromyalgia. But gender dysphoria is not a physiological issue. The premise of “gender-affirming care” is that changing the cosmetic appearance of a child’s body to resemble the opposite sex will alleviate his or her underlying mental and emotional distress. But not a single study has demonstrated any mental health benefits. One of the most comprehensive studies on long-term effects of transitioning, performed in Sweden, showed that after surgery, transgender-identifying people were more likely to commit suicide, at a rate 19 times higher than the average population. The “60 Minutes+” report cited the Obama-era Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services finding that 35% of transgender-identifying youth attempted suicide, but failed to report that it declined to endorse the transgender community’s medical recommendations because of the Swedish study. 4. The pharmaceutical companies that are making millions from “transgender medicine.” Cross-sex hormones cost upward of $2,400 for injectable estrogen and up to $4,200 for testosterone patches—per year. If a 15-year-old girl starts on puberty blockers, which she will need to take over the course of her entire lifetime, the cost will be more than $100,000. In addition, the cost of surgical transition—including removal of breasts and genitalia, shaping the genitalia to look like that of the opposite sex, and facial masculinization or feminization surgery—is estimated to be more than $100,000. Many interested parties—including medical doctors, insurers, and pharmaceuticals manufacturers—stand to make significant profits from the “gender-affirming” care model. “60 Minutes+” interviewed Dr. Michele Hutchison, who testified against the SAFE Act and joined the American Civil Liberties Union’s lawsuit to block the law from going into effect. She says that “watchful waiting” is dangerous for children—even though 88% of girls and 98% of boys accept their bodies after puberty, according to the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.” Hutchison’s gender clinic profits from her patients receiving hormones and surgeries. The failure to disclose her financial stake in the game ;is like asking a cigarette manufacturer about age limits on smoking and bans on advertising cigarettes to kids. 5. The lawmakers who are banning counseling that would help children accept their own bodies. Parents who find their sons and daughters struggling with their own bodies want to find counselors who will diagnose underlying conditions related to gender dysphoria, such as autism, trauma, anxiety, and stress. Yet in 24 states, this counseling is banned. I told “60 Minutes+” that transgender activists seek to silence dissenting viewpoints. They did not interview any of the lawmakers who enacted the counseling bans, and although they interviewed the ACLU, which supports these bans, they didn’t raise that question. As Crystal, the mother of a gender-dysphoric son, writes, “The only speech New Jersey allows is promoting ‘sex transition’ to children and youth … . Transitioning to the opposite sex is biologically impossible … . Children and youth struggling with their gender identity should be allowed to discuss ‘why’ they feel uncomfortable in their bodies.” Lawmakers who silence counselors that affirm the body also silence the voices of children and youth who want to feel comfortable with their bodies, but struggle to do so. When children and parents can’t find counselors and doctors to treat gender distress through talk therapy, all they are left with is “gender-affirming care.” That censorship is something that journalists should be especially concerned about, but was a side of the story that “60 Minutes+” didn’t include. Throughout the hourlong interview with “60 Minutes+,” the reporter denied the fact that gender dysphoria is the underlying mental health issue that children struggle with, which leads them and their parents to accept the recommendations of gender-affirming counselors and doctors. >>> Don’t Be Fooled: Gender Identity Policies Don’t Follow the Science Young people such as Dylan are given prescriptions for testosterone because they have received a gender-dysphoria diagnosis. Some transgender-identifying people don’t experience gender dysphoria. But gender dysphoria is well-understood to be the underlying condition that leads most children, youth, and adults to identify as transgender. The World Professional Association for Transgender Health’s “Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People” recommends that youths with gender dysphoria be treated with hormones and surgeries. It doesn’t recommend that for those who identify as transgender. “60 Minutes+” also included a segment with Dr. Rachel Levine, a transgender advocate who is an assistant secretary at the federal Department of Health and Human Services. At Levine’s Senate committee confirmation hearing, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., asked why “gender-affirming care” should be allowed on American children since genital mutilation is universally condemned as a human rights abuse. Levine contended the comparison between genital mutilation and “gender-affirming care” is “entirely incorrect,” claiming that the latter is based upon literature, the advice of professional groups, and evidence. In other words, trust the experts without examining what’s really involved in these surgeries. Paul is right to raise these questions about the dangers of “gender-affirming care.” The administration of puberty blockers almost invariably leads to cross-sex hormones and surgery that results in permanent sterilization. Since at least one country’s highest court has ruled that children are unable to give informed consent to those procedures, and other medical organizations in both the U.S. and abroad are raising similar concerns, America should have an open and honest debate about these grave matters. Unfortunately, “60 Minutes+” showed only one side of these debates. For the sake of children, Americans need to see and hear both sides of the debates to judge for themselves.

Anderson, Ph.D."], "date": "Aug 3, 2020 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/transitioning-procedures-dont-help-mental-health-largest-dataset-shows", "takeaways": ["The largest dataset on sex-reassignment procedures—both hormonal and surgical—reveals that such procedures do not bring the promised mental health benefits.", "People who experience a gender identity conflict should be treated with respect and compassion. And they deserve to know the truth.", "We need to find better, more humane, and effective responses to those who experience dysphoria."], "text": "The world’s largest dataset on patients who have undergone sex-reassignment procedures reveals that these procedures do not bring mental health benefits. But that’s not what the authors originally claimed. Or what the media touted. In October 2019, the American Journal of Psychiatry published a paper titled, “Reduction in Mental Health Treatment Utilization Among Transgender Individuals After Gender-Affirming Surgeries: A Total Population Study.” As the title suggests, the paper claimed that after having had sex-reassignment surgeries, a patient was less likely to need mental health treatment. Well, over the weekend, the editors of the journal and the authors of the paper issued a correction. In the words of the authors, “the results demonstrated no advantage of surgery in relation to subsequent mood or anxiety disorder-related health care.” But it’s actually worse than that. The original results already demonstrated no benefits to hormonal transition. That part didn’t need a correction. So, the bottom line: The largest dataset on sex-reassignment procedures—both hormonal and surgical—reveals that such procedures do not bring the promised mental health benefits. In fact, in their correction to the original study, the authors point out that on one score—treatment for anxiety disorders—patients who had sex-reassignment surgeries did worse than those who did not: You would think patients suffering from gender dysphoria would want to know that. What led to the correction? A deluge of criticisms and letters to the editor. One of the first scholars to raise questions about the original study was Mark Regnerus, a professor of sociology at the University of Texas at Austin. Writing at Public Discourse (the Journal of the Witherspoon Institute, which I edit), Regnerus praised the study for having such a robust dataset. But he pointed out oddities in the way the authors presented the results to the public, and which results the media touted. For example, Regnerus highlighted that “the study found no mental health benefits for hormonal interventions in this population.” He also pointed out that in a dataset of 9.7 million people, the results of the original analysis the authors put forward hinged on the outcomes of just three people: Furthermore, Regnerus noted how small the impact of any given surgery was, that a clinic would need to perform 49 surgeries before they could expect a patient to benefit—hence the plural in the original paper’s title: surgeries. As Regnerus put it, “the beneficial effect of surgery is so small that a clinic may have to perform 49 gender-affirming surgeries before they could expect to prevent one additional person from seeking subsequent mental health assistance.” Given all of these concerns, why the media celebration of the study? Why the “consensus” among the medical elite that transitioning benefits patients? Why the claim that it’s the only acceptable treatment? Why are children being “transitioned”? And why are parents being told puberty-blocking drugs, cross-sex hormones, and surgeries are the only way to treat their children? As I pointed out two years ago in my book, “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment,” the best therapies focus on helping people accept and embrace their bodies. Rather than attempting to do the impossible—“reassigning” bodies to line up with misguided thoughts and feelings—we should at least attempt what is possible: helping people to align their thoughts and feelings with reality, including the reality of the body. It shouldn’t surprise us that the results of this most recent study—and its correction—show that hormonal and surgical transition procedures don’t bring the promised benefits. Even the Obama administration admitted that the best studies do not report improvement after reassignment surgery. In August 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid wrote that “the four best designed and conducted studies that assessed quality of life before and after surgery using validated (albeit non-specific) psychometric studies did not demonstrate clinically significant changes or differences in psychometric test results after GRS [gender reassignment surgery].” What does that mean? A population of patients is suffering so much that these patients would submit to amputations and other radical surgeries, and the best research the Obama administration could find suggests that these surgeries bring them no meaningful improvements in their quality of life. And sadly, such surgeries can have deadly consequences. In a discussion of the then-largest and most robust study on sex reassignment, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pointed out: “The study identified increased mortality and psychiatric hospitalization compared to the matched controls. The mortality was primarily due to completed suicides (19.1-fold greater than in control Swedes).” These results are tragic. And they directly contradict the most popular media narratives, as well as many of the snapshot studies that do not track people over time. Indeed, the Obama administration noted that “mortality from this patient population did not become apparent until after 10 years.” So when the media tout studies that track outcomes only for a few years, and claim that reassignment is a stunning success, there are good grounds for skepticism. Indeed, it will be interesting to see which media outlets report on this past weekend’s correction—and the true results of the study. As I point out in “When Harry Became Sally,” gender dysphoria is a serious condition. People who experience a gender identity conflict should be treated with respect and compassion. And they deserve to know the truth. Now the world’s largest relevant dataset reveals hormones and surgeries don’t bring wholeness and happiness. We need to find better, more humane, and effective responses to those who experience dysphoria."},
{"title": "4 Ways the Equality Act Would Harm Children", "author": ["Andrea  Jones"], "date": "Oct 1, 2020 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/4-ways-the-equality-act-would-harm-children", "takeaways": ["The Equality Act’s impact would be felt in a number of areas, including medicine, education, sports and parental rights.", "Experimental use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones on children can carry serious consequences, including delayed brain development and permanent sterility.", "Children are not pawns to be manipulated for the sake of adult political disputes, and Americans should reject this bill’s approach to their safety and welfare."], "text": "Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, has declared passing and signing the Equality Act to be among his top legislative priorities to be completed in his first 100 days in office. This legislation, which the House of Representatives passed last year, would add sexual orientation and gender identity as protected categories under the Civil Rights Act. But rather than shielding Americans who identify as LGBT from unfair discrimination, the bill’s provisions would be weaponized by activists against anyone who disagrees with their radical and politicized ideology. This ideology is out of touch with the majority of Americans and would particularly harm vulnerable children. The Equality Act’s impact would be felt in a number of areas, including medicine, education, sports, and parental rights. 1. Curriculum: The bill could lead to federal courts or future presidential administrations imposing a nationwide mandate to incorporate sexual orientation and gender identity into the curriculum in all public schools. A number of states already use similar curriculum, including graphic and age-inappropriate sex education for children as young as kindergarten and requiring the inclusion of LGBT history. These schools frequently find ways to circumvent standard parental notification and opt-out procedures, as LGBT activists’ stated goal is to reach children whose parents are not “affirming” of gender ideology. Parents can expect similar developments on a national scale if the Equality Act becomes law. 2. Schools: The Equality Act would also affect children at school. First, it would mandate that schools across the country allow students who identify as transgender to access the opposite sex’s restrooms, locker rooms, and showers. It would also require them to allow biological males to compete on girls sports teams, where they have a clear physical advantage. Other provisions of the bill could, under the guise of preventing bullying and harassment, require teachers and students to use the preferred names and pronouns of those who identify as transgender. 3. Medicine: The Equality Act would require medical professionals to perform irreversible gender-transition procedures on minors, regardless of conscientious objection or best medical judgment. The experimental use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones on children can carry serious consequences, including delayed brain development and permanent sterility. The bill’s findings also pave the way for an eventual ban on any counseling intended to help children with gender dysphoria accept their bodies. Given that 80%-95% of children eventually come to identify with their biological sex if they do not undergo social transition, employing federal law to ban counseling for children is a mistake. 4. Adoption, foster care, and parental rights: Finally, the Equality Act would significantly affect the child welfare system. Faith-based adoption and foster care providers would risk losing federal funds if they decline to place children with same-sex couples. This in turn could lead to these providers being forced to close, displacing thousands of children and further straining an already overwhelmed system. Prospective foster parents could also be required to affirm a foster child’s stated gender identity and barred from any efforts to help a child with gender dysphoria accept his or her body. The majority of Americans oppose these policies, and many more are likely to have reservations about them. A Heritage Foundation poll showed 66% of parents are opposed to curriculum like California’s Healthy Youth Act that teaches children about sexual orientation and gender identity. In another Heritage poll, nearly 60% of those surveyed oppose the Equality Act’s provisions on transgender medical treatment, counseling bans for children with gender dysphoria, and allowing biological males to compete on girls sports teams. A majority opposed allowing students to use the opposite sex’s restrooms and locker rooms at schools, and 43% opposed requiring the use of preferred names and pronouns of students who identify as transgender. Around one-fourth of respondents said they did not know or preferred not to answer each question, reflecting a high level of uncertainty about a sensitive topic. The activist left has labeled all disagreement as bigotry, stifling the voices of those who raise concerns. Policies such as the Equality Act—which are being promoted by a presidential campaign and endorsed by one house of Congress—would turn the shield of anti-discrimination law into a sword to punish disagreement, with the youngest Americans as collateral damage. Children are not pawns to be manipulated for the sake of adult political disputes, and Americans should reject this bill’s approach to their safety and welfare."},

On Wednesday, the Girl Scouts of the USA tweeted congratulations to new Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett on becoming only the fifth woman appointed to the court since its inception in 1789. The tweet featured an image of Barrett along with justices Sandra Day O’Connor, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. This celebration of a rare accomplishment for women drew such outrage from the left that the organization immediately bent a knee to the rage mob and quickly deleted it. The Girl Scouts issued a statement saying the post was “viewed as a political and partisan statement which was not our intent and we have removed the post. Girl Scouts of the USA is a nonpolitical, nonpartisan organization … We are here to lift up girls and women.” That statement is pure ridiculousness. No reasonable person could read the original tweet as remotely partisan, especially since it featured three Democrat-appointed justices and two Republican-appointed ones. Taking down the post in response to the lunatic ravings of left-wing partisans is actually what’s partisan here. And by taking down a tweet that celebrated the tremendous accomplishments of these five women, the Girl Scouts is doing the exact opposite of lifting up girls and women. They are telling girls that if enough people complain, they will cower and refuse to stand up for women. They are also choosing to be complicit with the left’s notion that it’s okay to disrespect women with whom they disagree. Neither is an appropriate message to send to young girls. The reality is, Justice Barrett should be celebrated. She is an inspiration for women and girls everywhere. She is brilliant and accomplished, and yet remains humble. And the fact that she has seven school-age children and at the same time has held jobs as a law professor, a federal judge, and now a justice on the highest court in the land demonstrates to other women that they can successfully balance a career and family if they choose a similar path. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, when America finally recognized women’s right to vote. Yet as we saw this week, some women are still treated as unequal—not just as unequal to men, but unequal to other women. The fact is, there is a different standard applied to women depending on whether they are liberal or conservative. Many on the left openly heap contempt and scorn onto conservative women. They consider their ideas and accomplishments inferior. They equate being conservative, pro-life and female as somehow being self-hating and opposed to the full equality of women. In their minds, women like Justice Barrett—and the millions and millions of women who share her views—are not fully equal to them. I’ve experienced this kind of discrimination my entire career as a conservative women. In the 1960s, I marched in the civil rights movement so that someday I could be treated equally alongside white people. When I got a little older, I also desperately wanted to fight for my equal rights as a woman, but I had a harder time doing it because the feminist movement kept me and others like me out. We were too pro-life and too conservative to be considered equal. When Justice Ginsburg died, many conservatives who strongly disagreed with her judicial philosophy—including us at The Heritage Foundation—still issued statements recognizing her service on the court. But this kind of civility often doesn’t go both ways. Unfortunately, by giving in to the rage mob, the Girl Scouts has chosen sides and has only given the mob more power. This former Girl Scout isn’t fooled by the organization’s rhetoric about being neutral on political issues. Somehow, in their minds, the left thinks that being “neutral” and “nonpolitical” means supporting liberal and leftist women while disavowing millions of conservative women and girls who disagree with their agenda. This latest incident just exposes the Girl Scout’s leanings once again. The Girl Scout Law says in part, “I will do my best to be honest and fair … and responsible for what I say and do, and to respect myself and others.” That’s why when you’re not being honest and fair, when you’re not being responsible with what you say and do, and when you fail to respect those who don’t share your political views, you need to be called out for the incredible hypocrites that you are."},

Kay Coles James", "author": [], "date": null, "url": "https://www.heritage.org/staff/the-hon-kay-coles-james", "takeaways": [], "text": "James is Heritage’s former president and a leader in government, academia, and the conservative movement. Kay Coles James served as the president of The Heritage Foundation, America’s premier conservative think tank, from 2018-2021. She has also served as a trustee of the board from 2005-2022. Throughout her tenure at Heritage, she was dedicated to helping formulate and promote solutions to the many issues Americans face—from fighting poverty to improving our schools and our health care system to reducing the size and scope of government. These public policy solutions are based on the principles of individual freedom, limited government, free enterprise, traditional American values, and a strong national defense. >>> More from Kay C. James: Statements | Op-Eds With an unwavering commitment to Heritage’s members, its board and staff, and to the American people, Mrs. James pushed the organization to new heights. Under her leadership, for three years in a row, Heritage was named the No. 1 think tank in the world for its impact on public policy by the University of Pennsylvania’s Think Tanks and Civil Societies Program, the world’s leading authority on the role policy institutes play in governments and civil societies around the globe. One of her great passions was guiding Heritage in its outreach and sharing of its message with young people, minorities, and women who don’t necessarily consider themselves conservative but who practice conservative principles in their own lives. Born in Portsmouth, Virginia, and raised in her early years in Richmond’s housing projects to a single mother in the segregated South, Mrs. James was one of the first children to take part in a historic experiment to desegregate Virginia’s all-white schools. She would go on to achieve the American dream, graduating from the historically black Hampton University; serving four U.S. presidents; dining with princes, prime ministers, and other world leaders; and helping America chart a path for recovery from the devastation of COVID-19 as the chairman of the National Coronavirus Recovery Commission. Before becoming president of Heritage, Mrs. James was a lifelong grassroots activist who unapologetically fought for conservative, American values at the local, state, and national level. A devout Christian, her experience growing up in poverty with a mother on welfare and an alcoholic father played a profound role in fundamentally shaping her views on the importance of family and religion, the value of education, the need for welfare reform, and the repeated failure of well-intentioned government programs, especially in America’s urban communities. As she has often said, “I didn’t become a conservative despite my roots; I became a conservative because of them.” Much of her adult life has been spent fighting for policies that promote family and education instead of more government as remedies to poverty. She mentors young people and works to instill in them the value of education as a means to achieving success. She crafted education policy during her time on the Virginia State Board of Education and the Fairfax County School Board. And she served as dean of the Robertson School of Government at Regent University in Virginia Beach, where she led the accreditation initiative for the school of government. Mrs. James also served on the Virginia Commonwealth University board of visitors, where she and her fellow board members led the effort to fulfill the university president’s goal of making VCU a leading research institution in Virginia. She continues to promote school choice so that parents can send their children to the schools that best meet their needs, and she advocates that decisions about education are best made by the people closest to the students—local school boards and the states, but rarely the federal government. An ardent pro-lifer, she was drawn to the life issue out of a desire to protect society’s most vulnerable. She worked for several pro-life organizations and served as the chief spokesperson for the National Right to Life Committee in the 1980s. She even opened her own crisis pregnancy center and counseled young women against abortion. Mrs. James was appointed by President Ronald Reagan and then reappointed by President George H.W. Bush to the National Commission on Children, an advisory body on children’s issues. She also served under President Bush as associate director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and as assistant secretary for public affairs at the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services. Following her time in the George H.W. Bush administration, Virginia Gov. George Allen appointed her as Virginia’s secretary of health and human resources. As secretary, she designed and implemented Virginia’s landmark welfare reform initiative that set time limits and imposed work requirements for welfare recipients. She also used her position to influence housing policies regarding young, elderly, and low-income Virginians. In 2001, Mrs. James was appointed director of the U. S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) by President George W. Bush and led a department of 3,600 employees. As director, she was the federal government’s chief personnel officer, responsible for all personnel practices and programs, and served as President Bush’s principal advisor in matters of personnel administration for the 1.8 million members of the federal civil service. In her position as director of OPM, in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on America, she designed and oversaw the process by which nearly 170,000 employees from 22 different agencies merged into the newly created Department of Homeland Security. In 2016, a fourth U.S. president turned to her for assistance. President-elect Donald Trump asked her to serve as a senior advisor on his presidential transition team. Once in office, President Trump appointed her as a commissioner on the Women’s Suffrage Centennial Commission, which she chaired. She also advised the president frequently on matters ranging from immigration reform to support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. During her career, she also served as a senior fellow and director of The Citizenship Project at The Heritage Foundation, as the senior vice president of the Family Research Council, as the director of public affairs at the National Right to Life Committee, and as the executive vice president and chief operating officer for the One to One Partnership, a national umbrella organization for mentoring programs. She was also the director of community education and development for Housing Opportunities Made Equal of Virginia. In 2001, Mrs. James founded The Gloucester Institute and served as its president and board chairman. The organization trains and nurtures college-age men and women in the African American community and focuses on shaping a new generation of conservative leaders. Through Mrs. James’ leadership, The Gloucester Institute has been committed to providing an intellectually safe environment where ideas can be discussed and transformed into practical solutions for our country. She has served on several other boards and commissions, including the Virginia Empowerment Commission, the Medicaid Commission, the Carter-Baker Commission on Federal Election Reform, the NASA Advisory Council, the Focus on the Family board of directors, Young Life’s board of directors, and the national advisory board of the Salvation Army. She served on several corporate boards, including PNC Financial Services Group, Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Phycor, Magellan Health Services, and Amerigroup Corporation. She was a member of the National Association of Corporate Directors and has done continuing board education at the Harvard School of Business. Mrs. James has received numerous honorary degrees and awards, including a doctor of laws from Pepperdine University, the University of Virginia’s Publius Award for Public Service, and the Spirit of Democracy Award for Public Policy Leadership from the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation. As a commentator, lecturer, and policy leader, she appears on numerous national news and talk programs, and her opinion pieces appear in newspapers across the country. She is the author of three books about personal success and growth: her award-winning autobiography, Never Forget (1994); Transforming America from the Inside Out (1995); and What I Wish I’d Known Before I Got Married (2001). She is the wife of Charles James, Sr., and the proud mother of three grown children and five grandchildren."},

Privacy and safety at a shelter, equality on an athletic field, and good medicine are at stake for everyone."], "text": "In his inaugural address, President Joe Biden stressed he wants to be the president of all Americans—left and right—and bring healing and unity to the nation. Actions speak louder than words. And on his very first day in office, Biden signed a radically divisive executive order mandating the transgender agenda. Here’s what it says: “Children should be able to learn without worrying about whether they will be denied access to the restroom, the locker room, or school sports.” “People should be able to access health care and secure a roof over their heads without being subjected to sex discrimination.” And here’s what it means: Boys who identify as girls must be allowed to compete in the girls’ athletic competitions, men who identify as women must be allowed in women-only spaces, healthcare plans must pay for gender-transition procedures, and doctors and hospitals must perform them. Sounds unifying, right? In reality, it spells the end of girls’ and women’s sports as we know them. And, of course, no child should be told the lie that they’re “trapped in the wrong body,” and adults should not pump them full of puberty-blocking drugs and cross-sex hormones. With this executive order, the so-called “transgender moment” has arrived at the White House. If you want to prepare yourself to effectively respond, you’ll want to read my book, “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment.” The Biden executive order cites Justice Neil Gorsuch’s majority opinion in Bostock v. Clayton County as justification for this radically divisive transgender policy. But although the simplistic logic of the Gorsuch opinion in Bostock suggests some pretty bad outcomes, we can—and should—resist Gorsuch’s simplistic logic. Here’s how Gorsuch summarizes his own test: “If the employer intentionally relies in part on an individual employee’s sex when deciding to discharge the employee—put differently, if changing the em­ployee’s sex would have yielded a different choice by the em­ployer—a statutory violation has occurred.” Now change the word “employer” to teacher, principal, coach, doctor, health care plan, or homeless shelter, and change the word “employee” to student, athlete, patient, or housing guest. “If the coach relies on the athlete’s sex—if changing the athlete’s sex would yield a different choice…” “If the homeless shelter relies on the guest’s sex—if changing the guest’s sex would yield a different choice…” The outcomes don’t look very good. Privacy and safety at a shelter, equality on an athletic field, and good medicine are at stake for everyone. We can—and should—defend commonsense policies that take seriously the bodily differences that provide valid bases in some areas of life (locker and shower rooms, athletics, women’s shelters, health care) for treating males and females differently (yet still equally). An unstated, frequently unexplored aspect of any “discrimination” claim is that two instances be “comparable,” that the two employees, or athletes, or patients, or shelter guests be “similarly situated.” Perhaps in the employment context Gorsuch couldn’t see this, but health, education, and housing provide starker instances. Start with health. Consider a case where a patient accuses a doctor or hospital or health care plan of “discrimination” because they won’t perform or offer or pay for breast removal as part of a “gender transition” procedure. The first thing to note is that Gorsuch’s test—“if changing the patient’s sex would have yielded a different choice by the doctor”—doesn’t apply. Change the patient’s sex and there are no breasts to remove. Indeed, as I point out in “When Harry Became Sally,” recognizing differences between the sexes is increasingly regarded as vitally important for good medical practice, because scientists have found that male and female bodies tend to be susceptible to certain diseases in different ways, to differing degrees, and that they respond to treatments differently. These differences do not have to do with how people choose to “identify.” They have to do with what men and women are: males or females of the human species. The Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences published a report in 2001 titled “Exploring the Biological Contributions to Human Health: Does Sex Matter?” The executive summary answered the question in the affirmative, saying that the explosive growth of biological information “has made it increasingly apparent that many normal physiological functions—and, in many cases, pathological functions—are influenced either directly or indirectly by sex-based differences in biology.” Because genetics and physiology are among the influences on an individual’s health, the “incidence and severity of diseases vary between the sexes.” Far from its being discrimination to “rely on a patient’s sex,” it is a requirement of good medicine, which is sex-specific to the male or female body of the patient. But that’s not all. Suppose the argument is that the doctor/hospital/insurer covers double mastectomies in the case of cancer, but not in the case of gender dysphoria. For a discrimination claim to be successful, you’d have to argue that a patient with cancerous breast tissue is comparable, similarly situated to a patient with healthy breast tissue. Perhaps some physicians will argue that the non-cancerous breasts are in fact unhealthy because they are the cause of the gender dysphoria. That will only further highlight that what we really have here is a disagreement about the diagnosis and treatment of gender dysphoria. And policies—like the Trump administration’s regulation on Section 1557 of the ACA—are entirely defensible for refusing to treat a disagreement on medical care as if it were discrimination based on identity. Something similar is true for the Trump policies on Title IX and school sports. For an argument about discrimination to succeed, you’d have to say that an athlete with male muscle mass, bone structure, and lung capacity (to take just a few specifics) is comparable, similarly situated to an athlete with female muscle mass, bone structure, and lung capacity. If you can recognize that these are not in fact comparable, similarly situated individuals, then it’s hard to make a claim that “discrimination” in the pejorative sense has occurred. Yes, we’ve treated males and females differently—we have an NBA and a WNBA—but that is precisely in order to treat them equally. Equality—fairness—in athletic competition frequently requires taking the bodily differences between males and females seriously. By comparison, it never requires taking skin color into account. Thankfully, the days of racially segregated sports are over. Our skin color makes no difference to what we do on the athletic field. Nor does it make a difference in the bathroom, locker room, or shelter. That’s why bans on racial discrimination did away with separate facilities for black and white. But bans on sex discrimination did not do away with separate facilities for male and female—a reality that Gorsuch’s simplistic test for discrimination fails to account for. The reason? A person with male genitalia is not comparable, not similarly situated to a person with female genitalia when it comes to an emergency shelter or locker room. As a result, this aspect of the Trump administration’s Housing and Urban Development rule on sex-based housing is eminently defensible. Biden is now in the process of undoing these Trump-era administrative actions. Thus, we’ll need litigation and legislation not solely on religious liberty, but on the substantive issues at stake: privacy and safety in single-sex facilities, equality and fairness in single-sex sports, and good medicine based on the realities of our biological make up as male or female human beings. Through litigation and legislation, we need to make it clear that it’s lawful to act on the convictions that we are created male and female, and that male and female are created for each other, that no institution has to let males compete against females in sports, that no institution has to allow males into women-only locker-rooms and shelters, that no physician has to engage in so-called “gender-affirming” care.

In 2020, the median earnings of all full-time wage-earning and salaried female workers were 18% lower than males. That would be a problem if women were being paid less to do the exact same jobs as men, or if women were not allowed to pursue the same higher-paying jobs and careers as men. But what’s at play is not differences in earnings so much as a difference in choices that men and women tend to make regarding their careers, their jobs, and—in particular—parenthood. Women historically have earned less than men because they had lower education and because cultural discrimination was more prevalent. Now, women achieve as much, and often more, education compared with men; they’ve proven themselves equally capable as men in the workplace; and they’ve got the law and the competitive free market on their side. As a result, women’s earnings have increased substantially. A recent study found that young, single women living in cities actually outearn their male counterparts. And yet, a persistent gap remains between the average wages of women and men. Logical factors, such as occupation, experience, and time out of the workforce explain almost the entirety of gender-based pay differences. A 2020 Payscale.com analysis found that the pay gap declined from 19% to 2% after controlling for different choices men and women make. An analysis by Harvard researchers of a unionized environment with rigid pay scales that prohibited discrimination similarly found that “the weekly earnings gap can be explained by the workplace choices that women and men make,” with women choosing to take more unpaid leave and to work fewer overtime hours than men. Choice of occupation also plays a role. A 2014 study of federal employees’ wages found that the average woman earned 11% less than the average man. Within pay grades, earnings were equal, but the difference was the result of more women working in lower-paying occupations. Most notably, those choices often have to do with parenthood. Recent research indicates that most—perhaps all—of the so-called gender pay gap is caused by the different impact that children have on women and men. Very generally speaking, men respond to fatherhood by pursuing promotions and higher pay—presumably out of a desire to provide financially for their families—while women tend to seek less demanding work outside the home so that they can spend more time with children. A study by the New York Federal Reserve Board confirms these preferences. Women were willing to give up 7.3% of their annual earnings in exchange for a part-time work option, while men were willing to give up only 1% of their earnings. And while men were willing to give up 3.4% of their earnings for a job with higher future earnings potential, women were only willing to give up 0.6%. Paychecks aren’t the measure of people’s worth. Rather, people value the freedom to pursue the careers, families, and hobbies they desire. Moreover, there’s tremendous personal and societal value to the things people do while not working for wages—such as caring for and raising children and volunteering. Since equality of opportunity—not outcomes—is the American ideal, women’s (and men’s) abilities to pursue the career and family paths that work best for them should be the focus. Experience with policymakers’ attempts to equalize outcomes—both within the U.S. and abroad—have often resulted in unintended consequences on women, men, and children. In the U.S., the 1993 Family Medical Leave Act—guaranteeing unpaid, job-protected leave—had the unintended consequence of reducing women’s chances of being promoted by 8 percentage points. And state-based paid family-leave programs in New Jersey and California reduced young women’s employment and earnings. Neither Sweden’s nor Norway’s “daddy quota” programs—which reserve part of families’ paid parental leave exclusively for men—improved women’s labor market outcomes. Norway’s had “strong and statistically significant negative effects on women’s labor market outcomes,” and Sweden’s increased parental separations and divorce, and reduced household incomes as women took more unpaid time off. Similarly, heavily subsidized child care programs have failed to help women. In Austria, large expansions in subsidized child care had “zero effect on mothers’ careers, in the short run as well as in the long run,” and Quebec’s $5-per-day government child care led to “striking evidence that children are worse off in a variety of behavioral and health dimensions,” and “that the new child care program led to more hostile, less consistent parenting, worse parental health, and lower-quality parental relationships.” Moreover, an analysis of 60 years’ worth of family policies intended to reduce labor market gender inequity in Austria found that “the massive expansion of family policies has had surprisingly little effect on the long-run evolution of gender inequality. If anything, it made things marginally worse.” That’s bad news for policymakers who are intent on forcing women to become more like men, or men to become more like women. Instead of trying to impose the outcomes of one person’s or one gender’s choices and aspirations onto another, policymakers and employers should help to expand the freedom and opportunity of all workers and all families to pursue what works best for them.

It would deny even the opportunity to say that government action burdens the exercise of religion."], "text": "The issues raised by the Equality Act are serious and need open, honest debate. But the March 17 hearing on this bill in the Senate Judiciary Committee showed that serious legislative consideration is impossible unless we are honest about what, on its face, the Equality Act would do. During the hearing, Alfonso David, president of the Human Rights Campaign, claimed that while the Equality Act would grant the right not to be discriminated against, it would not take any rights away from anyone. No one who has read the Equality Act could possibly believe that, let alone say so under oath. >>> 11 Myths About H.R. 5, the Equality Act of 2021 To see why, we must first consider another relevant federal statute, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). It provides that a person whose exercise of religion has been substantially burdened by government action may go to court and “obtain appropriate relief.” The government must show that its action burdening the person’s religious exercise is “the least restrictive means of furthering [a] compelling government interest.” Each of us, therefore, has the right to be free from all but the most necessary government burdens on our religious freedom. RFRA even states that “[f]ederal statutory law” adopted after RFRA’s enactment “is subject to this chapter unless such law excludes application by reference to this chapter.” We have this right to defend against government action that interferes with religious exercise unless Congress explicitly takes it away when enacting another statute. >>> Heritage Explains: The Equality Act in the Senate Enter the Equality Act. It states that the “Religious Freedom Restoration Act…shall not…provide a basis for challenging the application or enforcement of” the Equality Act’s provisions. In other words, if the Equality Act became law, no one would be allowed to claim that its application or enforcement substantially burdens their exercise of religion. RFRA gave us that right, the Equality Act would take it away. This is significant in several different ways. First, versions of the Equality Act dating back to 1994 included at least some language that protected religious freedom. Some of those versions even had a blanket exception for religious organizations. The current version not only drops any recognition of anyone’s religious freedom, but would deliberately prohibit any protection for that fundamental right whatsoever. Second, this would be the first time in history that Congress expressly rejected RFRA’s application. Third, that rejection would extend to every area that the Equality Act covers: employment, housing, public education, government programs, credit, jury service, public accommodations, and public facilities. >>> The Equality Act: Gaslighting Reality To be clear, RFRA applies only when a burden on the exercise of religion is caused by government action and that burden is substantial. At that point, it’s up to the courts to apply the RFRA standard to resolve the conflict. RFRA, therefore, does not automatically exempt anyone from obeying the law. Nor does it always shield any particular religious practice or insulate any government action. It simply says that government may not burden the right to exercise religion any more than absolutely necessary. RFRA allows each of us to challenge the government when we believe it has crossed that line. By contrast, the Equality Act would do what RFRA does not. It would deny even the opportunity to say that government action burdens the exercise of religion. It’s the very heads-I-win-tails-you-lose, all-or-nothing approach that Congress chose not to follow in RFRA. Congress is known to enact vague, confusing, and just generally messed-up statutes, but neither RFRA nor the Equality Act are among them on this point. What RFRA gaveth, the Equality Act would taketh away. The meaning, application, and broader implications of the Equality Act are profound. Anyone, of course, is free to believe that it should always trounce the constitutional right to exercise religion and, of course, has the obligation to defend that position. But as we debate the Equality Act, we must at least tell the truth that this is what’s at stake."},

The report of Ahmed Shaheed, the U.N. expert responsible for protecting religious freedom, advances a “progressive” agenda of abortion and new “rights” based on membership in sexual identity groups. It seems the U.N. is willing to trample the rights of the vulnerable and undermine the credibility of universal human rights to promote the values of a small number of wealthy countries—a travesty the Trump administration should oppose. The report to the infamous U.N. Human Rights Council undermines the empowerment of women and girls by lumping their concerns together with novel claims based on sexual orientation and gender identity. It includes a controversial interpretation of “gender equality” that promotes acceptance of transgender ideology and the concept of multiple, fluid, “gender identities.” At one time, “gender equality” referred exclusively to decreasing the many inequalities that women face. But the U.N. bureaucracy has begun attempting to redefine gender to include “gender identity,” referring both to women who identify as men and men who identify as women. In some nations, the creation of new rights based on gender identity has reduced safety and privacy for women and girls in places like shelters, prisons and public restrooms. It has also decreased their opportunities to excel in athletics by forcing them to compete against biological males. By focusing on the promotion of abortion and LGBT+ rights, the U.N. report turns the focus away from serious and pressing issues facing women and girls worldwide. Women comprise 52 percent of the victims of human trafficking each year, but the report makes no mention of this or of the work that religious groups do to combat it. >>>The U.N. Human Rights Council Disappoints Yet Again Instead, much of the report focuses on religion as justification for human-rights violations. The report accurately describes a few instances where religion is cynically used to justify human rights abuses perpetrated against women of minority faiths, including rape, forced sterilization and forced abortion. But then the report shockingly conflates conservative religious beliefs about life, marriage and biological sex with religious justifications for abhorrent human-rights violations.Eighty percent of the global population faces high restrictions on religious freedom, and many of these victims are women. But the report pays only superficial attention to this issue. Many women, as well as men, hold conservative religious beliefs, but the report treats their freedom to live according to these beliefs as secondary to abortion and new claims to rights based on sexual orientation and gender identity. No international treaty recognizes a right to abortion, but the report simply asserts that one exists and that it trumps a medical provider’s right to conscientious objection. The report goes so far as to suggest an expanded role for the state in doctrinal matters if a religious institution has “harmful discriminatory gender norms.” It goes as far as to criticize religious believers in Africa who oppose introducing school books that promote homosexuality. All people have human rights because of human dignity, including those who identify as LGBT, but this report bypasses the treaty negotiation process to simply assert that beliefs about sexual orientation and gender should trump the internationally-recognized human right of religious freedom. Where treaties are silent, the U.N. bureaucracy should respect member states’ sovereignty and freedom to make their own laws. When a new right is asserted, it should be scrutinized to determine if it violates fundamental human rights. The established process by which member states debate and vote should be followed. Bypassing this process devalues the votes of member states, particularly those that are small or poor. It opens the door to criticism that human rights are just a pretext for imposing Western values. The Holy See pointed this out, calling the report “ideological colonization.” The Trump administration has taken bold steps to protect human rights, including by elevating the voices of women who survived the ISIS genocide, Boko Haram and the Holocaust. By hosting two groundbreaking ministerial summits on protecting international religious freedom, the U.S. has also created important multilateral alliances. These alliances can do a great deal of good to protect this fundamental human right, including for women and girls. The U.N. bureaucracy should be a partner in this effort, not an adversary. But for this to happen, the United States and like-minded allies must hold U.N. bureaucrats accountable for protecting human rights according to the texts of treaties, rather than undermining their very purpose."},

What else could you reasonably expect it to mean besides “believe all women?”", " “Believe Women” was used interchangeably with mottos such as “Believe Survivors” and “Believe All Survivors.” ", "To suggest that the #MeToo movement didn't encompass a demand to \"believe all women\" is just pure revisionism."], "text": "Many of us were startled to open The New York Times last week and find ourselves accused of hijacking and weaponizing the phrase “believe all women.” According to journalist Susan Faludi, the phrase always has been “believe women,” and never has been associated with a demand for automatic and unquestioned belief that those who allege sexual assault are telling the truth. The “believe all women” line, in Faludi’s telling, is a false narrative perpetuated by what she calls the right wing. Apparently, the problems long pointed out with the premise of believing all women were, well, problems we—the “right wing”—created as a trap for an otherwise unblemished and unproblematic movement. This was particularly shocking to me. I remember the arguments for literally believing all women without question to be so strong that I wrote an article addressing them. Bari Weiss, who hardly could be called a right-winger, also understood this as a primary message of the movement, and was so concerned about its consequences that she publicly pushed back against it. Could our memories have been so wrong? Could we have misunderstood the basic premise of an entire social movement? Could it be that we trolled ourselves into knocking down a straw man? No. We’re being gaslighted. And we have the receipts to prove it. To give credit to Faludi, some feminist voices have warned that #BelieveWomen ought not to mean more than simply taking women seriously instead of immediately dismissing accusations. But to suggest that the broader #MeToo movement did not ever meaningfully encompass a demand to believe all women, in all accusations? Now that’s just pure revisionism. Let’s start with the phrase itself. While it was certainly never as popular as the shorter #BelieveWomen, it was embraced unironically by many groups, people, and outlets that are about as far from “right wing” as I am from a communist. National Public Radio, for example, would have been shocked to discover that “believe all women” was not, in fact, the legitimate “mantra” of the #MeToo movement, as it presumed. Writers at outlets such as Jezebel, The Guardian, and Bloomberg at various times made clear that “believe all women” was an important underlying norm of #MeToo. One Daily Beast article went so far as to refer to these years as “the era of believe all women.” Faludi taunts: “Good luck finding any feminist who thinks we should believe everything all women say—even what they say about sexual assault.” But here is an editor at Bustle demanding just that. You also can find the hashtag #BelieveAllWomen endorsed by a variety of liberal “Blue Checks” on Twitter, including Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., the ERA Coalition, comedian Greg Proops, singer Tara Sloane, and former Pepsico President Brad Jakeman. “Believe all women” was, in fact, such an important norm that society forced a prominent comedian to apologize for suggesting it was bad to turn “listen to women” into “believe all women.” The New York Times itself thought the phrase was so inextricably linked with #MeToo that it suggested the following discussion question in its series on how to teach about the movement: “Should we always ‘believe all women?’ What are the benefits and drawbacks of doing so?” But let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that no one outside of right-wing circles ever mentioned the phrase “believe all women” and that it was always, without exceptions, “believe women.” Is this fundamentally any different in its practical effect? “Believe women” is a categorical, unqualified statement. What else could you reasonably expect it to mean besides “believe all women?” Moreover, “Believe Women” was used interchangeably with mottos such as “Believe Survivors” and “Believe All Survivors,” which inherently presume that all women who make accusations are survivors, and are, ipso facto, to be believed. So you’ll have to forgive all of the prominent non-right-wing-hacks who found themselves completely confused and thinking that “believe women” meant “believe all women who make accusations are victims, simply because they made accusations.” The organizers of the Women’s March clearly believed this was the case, retweeting “We believe women” with an underlying tweet implying that a woman’s words of accusation alone should be sufficient evidence that she is to be believed. And as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., explained regarding accusations of sexual misconduct leveled at former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg: “I believe the women, and that means he isn’t telling the truth.” In other words, she thought the essence of “believing women” was that women who make accusations must be believed, and any defense put forward by the accused must be discredited. Full stop. This line of argument also was clearly seen in a Vox article about the “Republican response” to sexual assault allegations leveled at Donald Trump. Many of these allegedly “sad” responses were simply that the lawmakers hadn’t yet looked into the allegations. One of the apparently unacceptable responses, from Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, was precisely the response Faludi now says always has been the epitome of “believe women”—that the accusation should be taken seriously, but vetted. But to Vox, apparently, it was “predictable and sad” that politicians did not immediately believe the accusations, but rather wanted to look into the facts and assess credibility before forming an opinion. Finally, whatever moderating influences may have initially fought to separate #BelieveWomen from #BelieveAllWomen, the Senate confirmation hearings for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh destroyed any lingering pretense that automatic, unwavering belief was not accepted practice within the movement. Here, actions spoke louder than any words. From the very beginning, prominent Democrats made clear that the accusation alone was enough. Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, went so far as to state, prior to any hearing of the facts, that not only did she believe Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford, but that men should “just shut up” and believe her, too. Even afterward, when Kavanaugh was hit with allegations of sexual misconduct at Yale by Deborah Ramirez, many prominent Senate Democrats demanded his impeachment based on Ramirez’s accusation alone. “Believe all women” was never a right-wing trap. It always has been a very real part of the #MeToo movement, even though dissenters—conservative and liberal alike—have cautioned against such an untenable and reductionist approach. The question isn’t whether the right hijacked a phrase to create unreasonable standards. It didn’t. The question isn’t even whether the left will continue to abide by the standards it largely accepted and imposed on others when those standards no longer are politically expedient. It won’t—those standards already have been been subjected to quick and near-total abandonment for recent accusations against liberal politicians. The only remaining question is whether this newfound love of due process and fair-mindedness will continue for the next college student, celebrity, or conservative politician accused of misconduct. One can only hope. Unfortunately, it’s more than likely that when the pendulum swings back, the past will prove remarkably alterable: “We must ‘believe all women.’ We’ve always said ‘believe all women.’”"},

And if the sex binary can be canceled, who knows what’s next?"], "text": "We’re used to hearing forecasts of catastrophe in our political discourse, breezy assurances that apocalypse is sure to follow if a particular bill or program is either adopted or spurned. That makes it easy to dismiss such claims out of hand. But in the case of the Equality Act, which the House of Representatives takes up this week, fear is entirely warranted. If this bill is adopted, the fact that we are male or female is in danger of being replaced with the subjective concept of gender identity. The ramifications of this change, at the center of our universe of knowledge about human beings, would be profound. Making gender identity a protected class in the 1964 Civil Rights Act would discredit the idea that sex is binary, that men and women are different, and that recognition of these differences can be helpful to achieving justice and fairness in a variety of circumstances. A legal change of this magnitude, based on subjective and transient feelings, is unprecedented. But gender identity is riding on a powerful wave of identity politics that seeks to upend a perceived \"power structure\" that \"privileges\" those who are comfortable with their bodies. \"Cisgender normativity\" might be an easy concept to dismiss along with erasure of mother and father,\" and the introduction of \"chestfeeding.\" But to think of the gender identity revolution as merely another chapter in \"woke\" wonderland would be to miss the import of the linguistic, cultural, and political revolution for the integrity of education, medicine, and science. >>> Equality Act Is Trojan Horse for Abortion Lobby and More Like the heliocentric model, the sex binary was once consistently taught in every academic discipline and at all levels. Sex differences inform everything from our treatment of disease, to the benefits of single-sex education, to our understanding of parenting and leadership styles. But postmodernism, the sexual revolution, and critical gender and queer theory have firmly placed feelings at the center of academia, displacing empirical knowledge. Every discipline has been transformed, not just literature and history, but even the hard sciences. The Medical College Admissions Test now asks about the gender identity of patients. The American Association of Medical Colleges is the major accrediting body for medical schools. Its inclusion of this question signals to aspiring doctors that they must show not just knowledge and skills but ideological conformity. Every level of education has been affected. Kindergartners are reading \"I Am Jazz,\" the autobiography of TV star Jazz Jennings. The book depicts his delight at transitioning to \"being a girl\" but fails to mention the painful complications he experienced as a result of \"bottom surgery.\" To use the 1964 Civil Rights Act to turn a political ideology into a protected class will discredit the sex binary with official force. The Supreme Court’s ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County last summer fell prey to what Dr. Ryan T. Anderson has described as \"simplistic logic.\" Treating a male or a female less favorably than a person of the opposite sex simply because of their gender identity is unjust. However, ignoring differences in males and females also yields unjust results in many cases. Bostock addressed employment in civil rights law, but the Equality Act will reach much further into all public accommodations, education, housing, and all federally funded institutions. In Alaska, a women’s homeless shelter that housed battered women was forced to fend off a lawsuit from a man who sought to gain entry into its sleeping quarters. In Pennsylvania and Georgia, students and parents sued their schools for opening private facilities to the opposite sex. In Connecticut, three brave high school girls are suing the state for allowing two boys to take away their victories in track and field. >>> 11 Myths About H.R. 5, the Equality Act of 2021 Perhaps most alarming are the stories of regret from a growing number of \"detransitioners.\" Their bodies are scarred, their voices broken, and their fertility lost—casualties of hormones and surgeries that failed to deliver peace. Those who have tried to sound the alarm, such as feminist icon J.K. Rowling, tennis pioneer Martina Navratilova, and leading medical experts Dr. Paul McHugh, are bulldozed. Name, shame, cancel, repeat. If the Equality Act passes the House this week, it won’t be the result of new scientific discoveries about the sexes or the result of a thoughtful, open political debate. It will be the denial of all that previous generations around the world have learned and observed about sex differences over centuries. It will be the triumph of cancel culture over facts, reason, and empirical knowledge. And if the sex binary can be canceled, who knows what’s next?"},

It’s with cases like this in mind that Rep. Doug LaMalfa, R-Calif., has introduced legislation that would prohibit these procedures from being performed on minors in this country. “I should have been challenged on the proposals or the claims that I was making for myself,” 23-year-old Keira Bell said of her lawsuit. “And I think that would have made a big difference as well. If I was just challenged on the things I was saying.” Bell’s lawsuit comes in the wake of the resignation of whistleblowers at the clinic who raised concerns about the massive increase in the number of children—especially girls—referred for medical intervention with insufficient evaluation of the risks or other underlying factors contributing to the patients’ gender dysphoria. The U.K.’s minister for women and equalities recently announced plans to ban transgender medical interventions for those under 18. To protect American children from those harms, LaMalfa introduced a bill Aug. 11 to prevent these unproven and unethical medical interventions from being performed on minors in the United States. The legislation, HR 8012, marks an important step in the fight against politicized medicine that results in irreparable harm to children. Performing hormonal or surgical interventions on minors because they are experiencing discomfort with their bodies is a serious breach of medical ethics and leaves young patients with irreversible consequences. As Ryan T. Anderson and Robert P. George have written: Contrary to activists’ talking points, the effects of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones are neither risk-free nor reversible. The drugs commonly used to delay normally timed puberty in children who identify as transgender have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for that purpose, and there is no long-term studies to support their safety or effectiveness in treating gender dysphoria. There is evidence, however, demonstrating that these drugs have long-lasting negative side effects, such as reduced bone density and delayed brain development. Administering estrogen to boys or testosterone to girls eventually results in permanent sterility—a consequence that children are in no way equipped to consent to or even fully grasp the implications of. The evidence further suggests that medical transition does not carry the promised benefits for the health of gender dysphoric children. The authors of the largest study to date on the mental health outcomes of individuals who have undergone sex-reassignment surgery or hormonal transition were forced to admit that the data showed no decrease in mood or anxiety disorders for those who transitioned medically. In fact, individuals who underwent surgery were more likely to be treated for anxiety disorders than those who did not. Placing children on the path to transition also creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. The majority of children who transition socially eventually transition medically, and almost all children placed on supposedly reversible puberty blockers go on to take cross-sex hormones. In contrast, 80% to 95% of minors with gender dysphoria who do not transition either socially or medically come to accept their bodies. In America, the introduction of HR 8012 represents a growing legal and legislative pushback against transgender ideology in medicine around the world. Policymakers in the United States should carefully consider the abundant evidence that medical transitioning harms children and should work to protect them from the devastating consequences of abandoning sound medicine for ideology."},

", "Congress and the president should carefully consider the merits before changing the current policy on transgender service in the military."], "text": "Many predict that shortly after assuming office, former Vice President Joe Biden will move to rescind the Trump administration’s 2019 policy on military service by transgender individuals. That would be within his authority. Unless Congress intervenes, presidents set and revise entrance criteria for military service. Before he takes such action, however, he should consider the impact on military readiness. Unfortunately, there has been a near-complete lack of discussion and candor on that aspect. Indeed, a recent report, led by three former military surgeons general, suggested the current transgender policy hurt military readiness by shrinking the pool of available recruits. What the report and surgeons general did not mention was the risk involved by allowing individuals suffering from a bonafide medical condition from entering military service. The current policy prohibits transgender individuals who are suffering from gender dysphoria from entering service. In that respect, it is similar to many other medical conditions that prevent a volunteer from serving in the armed forces. Gender dysphoria is a recognized medical condition characterized by a marked incongruence between one’s self-identified gender and one’s biological sex. For a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, that incongruence must be so great that it causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, and other important areas of functioning. Medical criteria for military service exists for a purpose: to ensure volunteers are free of conditions that would require lost time from duty or hospitalization, and to ensure individuals are capable of performing duties without aggravating existing conditions. These criteria protect both the volunteer from unnecessary harm and protect the military from accepting an individual who may not be able to complete military service. There are hundreds of medical conditions that disqualify applicants from service, including asthma, plantar warts, or a history of anxiety disorders. Gender dysphoria, under current policy, is also a disqualifying disorder. Why? It is not—as some have suggested—due to a bias on the part of the military, any more than the armed forces are biased against those who suffering from asthma. Instead, it is because both military and civilian medical data unequivocally reflects that transgender individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria experience “high rates of mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression and substance abuse disorders.” For example, individuals with gender dysphoria attempt suicide at about nine times the rate of the general population. Service members diagnosed with gender dysphoria are also nine times more likely to have mental health encounters with a professional. There is more stress involved in military service than in most other professions. Deployments take service members far from home in austere conditions away from support networks. Suicide rates among the military have climbed lately, to the point where they exceed the rate of the general population. To allow an individual with gender dysphoria, already medically pre-disposed to anxiety, to enter a stressful profession such as the military, would frankly be immoral. This does not even get into the discussions of the additional costs and time lost by service members needing treatment for gender dysphoria. Those costs are real and the time spent away from military units are significant. Why then do critics of the current policy seek to define this discussion as mere societal bias against transgender individuals? Because, seemingly, they can. The media has categorically ignored the reams of medical data on the effects of gender dysphoria in favor of the more socially agreeable arguments that ascribe the current military policy to discrimination and prejudice. It is an emerging pattern where a teacher can be fired for using the wrong pronoun, or a school can hide information from parents on their child’s gender identity. America’s armed forces exist to defend the country and its national interests. Actions that reduce the readiness of these forces, such as modifying military entrance criteria to admit individuals with pre-existing medical conditions, create layers of risks that are born by our great service members, not those comfortably ensconced in Washington, D.C. Congress and the president should carefully consider the merits before changing the current policy on transgender service in the military."},

Unsurprisingly, people disagree about how best to respond to this condition in order to help these kids. How we navigate that disagreement will prove critical. Some people insist that the proper course of action involves experimental interventions directed at the boy or girl’s body itself—puberty-blocking drugs, cross-sex hormones, and surgery. Others suggest that therapy be directed to the child’s thoughts and feelings, not the body. Physical interventions on minors to “affirm” a mistaken “gender identity” violate sound medical ethics and should be prohibited. And yet, in all fifty states, such interventions are entirely legal. At the same time, a more radical movement is seeking to make it illegal to use a psychological approach to help these children rather than a hormonal and surgical one. An increasing number of jurisdictions—both in the US and in other countries—are banning therapy that aims to help minors with gender dysphoria feel comfortable about their own bodies without transforming their bodies. Federal legislation has been introduced that would create nationwide censorship of such therapy, and the UN has claimed that such therapy violates human rights. This turns medical ethics—and the law—upside down. Good therapy should never be prohibited. Children deserve access to the therapeutic assistance they need to feel comfortable being what they are as a plain and ineradicable matter of biological fact: male or female. And parents have a natural right to seek this care for their children. What’s Wrong with Therapy Bans Some argue that any attempt to help children feel comfortable and thrive as the sex they are, without transforming their bodies, is not good medicine, and they accuse practitioners of using abusive, harmful techniques. But they never provide credible evidence, and the therapy bans they support don’t target harmful practices. Instead, they prohibit working toward goals and outcomes that sexual progressive activists oppose. That is, these therapy bans aren’t focused on techniques that cause harm, but on certain objectives being sought—namely, being comfortable with one’s body. As a result, one-on-one counseling to help a teen struggling with body image due to anorexia would be permitted, but the very same counseling would be prohibited if the goal is to help a teen struggling with body image due to gender dysphoria. Activists use emotionally charged language, labelling all such techniques “conversion therapy.” They do not apply this label only to certain discredited techniques (such as electro-shock therapies), but to any therapeutic service—including basic talk therapy—to help a gender dysphoric youth feel comfortable without “transitioning.” Their argument is that if the true “gender identity” of the child is not being “affirmed,” then the child is being harmed. They claim that if a boy who “identifies” as a girl is helped to be comfortable with his actual and unalterable bodily sex, then “conversion therapy” is taking place—regardless of the counseling techniques deployed. What can be said about this? First, everyone should hope that minors experiencing gender dysphoria can find resolution without hormonal interventions or the amputations of perfectly healthy body parts. These are deeply invasive and often irreversible procedures that destroy functioning and alter visible physical structures. The best outcome is always for people to feel comfortable in their own skin and with their sexuality. So why ban that intended goal? Indeed, even if one thought that sometimes “transitioning” was the best outcome for a particular patient, is it really credible to say that it is always the best—indeed the only legally permissible—outcome to work towards? Second, these sorts of counseling bans engage in misguided—and unconstitutional—viewpoint discrimination and content censorship. The government is taking explicit sides in what sorts of speech a therapist can engage in during talk therapy, and thus what sort of assistance a family can seek. If a family asks a therapist to support, encourage, and facilitate a child’s “transitioning,” the therapist is fine. But if a family wants to help a child with gender dysphoria feel comfortable with his or her own body, then a therapist risks violating the law if he provides the requested help. That’s unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. Furthermore, the law allows therapists to engage in speech to help a child feel comfortable with his or her body when they struggle with any other body-image problem. Only when that problems stems from gender dysphoria is helping a child feel comfortable with his or her body prohibited. That’s unconstitutional content-based speech regulation—in plain English, censorship. Thus, these bans engage in two forms of unconstitutional speech restrictions. Third, there is no credible evidence to support such bans. The surge in gender dysphoria among minor children is a very recent phenomenon—tracking the rise of gender ideology. The United Kingdom, for example, has seen a 4,515 percent rise in gender dysphoria in girls over the past decade. Researchers have not had time to study the best therapeutic techniques for this modern form of gender dysphoria, let alone to say that the goal of helping a child feel comfortable with his or her bodily sex is always harmful and must be prohibited. So, not only do these bans turn medicine upside down and engage in viewpoint and content censorship, but they also have no empirical justification. Even if there were evidence that a certain technique was misguided, that wouldn’t justify banning all techniques and thus preventing families from pursuing wholeness for a child. Children Deserve Good Medicine It is absurd to pass laws banning therapy aimed at wholeness when we lack laws protecting children from actual unethical and harmful procedures in this area. As a preliminary point, the best available empirical studies show no benefit of either hormonal or surgical transition. But whatever one may think about the ethics of medical professionals’ “transitioning” adults, everyone should be able to agree that adults should not interfere with the natural, healthy development of the bodies and minds of children, as Robert George and I have explained. Children must be provided with the time and space to develop to maturity. To tell a child that he or she is the “wrong” sex – and is “actually” the opposite sex (or both sexes, or neither sex—something promoted today by standard children’s “gender” books), or to encourage a child’s mistaken belief that he is something other than a boy, or she is something other than a girl (however sensitively one may, and should, be handling such a situation), is deeply unjust to that child. To intervene in a child’s physical development, to block the child from going through normal puberty—all in an attempt to “affirm” a “gender identity” that rejects the child’s biological reality—is profoundly unethical. Administering cross-sex hormones to minors, in an attempt to make their bodies cosmetically resemble those of the opposite sex or of their preferred “gender identity,” is likewise a violation of sound ethical norms and the bodily integrity of minors. Amputating reproductive organs or breasts to “affirm” a “gender identity”—as done to thirteen-year-old girls who underwent double-mastectomies in taxpayer-funded “research”—is particularly heinous. Governments should prohibit this misuse of medical technology and protect children from these harms. By contrast, government should protect good medicine. The law must protect the freedom of parents to seek, children to receive, and doctors to practice good medicine. The law must protect the ability of doctors and families to help children feel comfortable as what they actually are, namely, male and female children—not to radically transform their bodies."},

Clayton, which ruled that the Title VII prohibition on sex discrimination in employment extends to discrimination based on sexual orientation and transgender status, is likely to have more widespread implications than many people realize. Many (including Justice Samuel Alito in his scathing dissent) warn that the ruling may undermine religious freedom and freedom of speech, as well as women’s athletics and women’s privacy in bathrooms and lockers rooms. Yet few have considered how Bostock may imperil the fundamental right of parents to educate their children in line with their values. The current culture already makes it difficult for parents to teach their children that, for instance, maleness and femaleness are grounded on objective biological reality rather than subjective self-perceptions, or that the purpose of human sexuality is not ultimately pleasure or self-expression, but to unite a man and woman in marriage and enable them to form a family. And whatever one’s beliefs about these issues, parents, not the state, should be the ones to decide what their children are taught about these controversial and sensitive matters. Many parents who seek to pass on a traditional understanding of sexuality send their children to private or religious schools where these values will be taught and modeled—or at least not directly undermined, as they are in an increasing number of public schools. But will private and religious schools be able to teach and model these traditional understandings of sexuality in the wake of Bostock? What happens when the first-grade teacher Ms. Clark announces that she is transgender and henceforth expects to be treated as Mr. Clark? According to Bostock, a school that fires Ms. Clark because her gender transition will confuse students and undermine the school’s mission would violate Title VII’s prohibition on sex discrimination. A religious school might be protected by Title VII’s exemption allowing religious institutions to make hiring decisions on the basis of religion, or by the Hosanna-Tabor ruling’s “ministerial exception,” which protects the right of religious institutions to choose their own ministers. The Bostock decision, however, doesn’t help matters. Thankfully, the Supreme Court just strengthened the ministerial exception in Our Lady of Guadalupe v. Morrissey Berru, offering a broad interpretation of who counts as a “minister” that likely extends to any teacher, and perhaps even other employees. But schools will have to fight for these protections in court when challenged, and the fight itself will be punishing. Further, what about private non-religious schools which are not eligible for these exemptions? LGBT activists will also seek to get courts to apply Bostock’s expansive redefinition of the meaning of sex discrimination to Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in any school or educational program that receives federal financial assistance. Justice Neil Gorsuch’s majority opinion explicitly declines to address questions about bathrooms, locker rooms, women’s sports, and so on. But the logic of Bostock implies that it would violate Title IX, for example, to prevent a student with male anatomy who identifies as female from changing and showering in the girls’ locker room or competing on the girls’ track team. These implications of Bostock’s logic could also affect the many private and religious schools which receive federal financial support indirectly through states and school districts that fund things like busing, textbooks or free meals for low-income students. If a second-grade boy at a Catholic school declares himself to be a girl and wants teachers and other students to treat him as such, will the school be forced to comply to avoid a lawsuit, regardless of whether this contradicts the school’s religious teachings? If, as is plausible, the answer to that question is yes, a growing number of parents will have no choice but to send their children into an educational environment that may sow profound confusion about the basic truths of human identity. Further, insofar as Bostock is interpreted (perhaps mistakenly) as affirming that sex is determined by a person’s inner sense of gender identity rather than by biology, parents of gender-confused children may find themselves unable to protect their children from the “gender-affirming” path of social transition, puberty blockers, and eventually cross-sex hormones and surgery. Never mind that the vast majority of gender-confused children naturally come to accept their biological sex if allowed to undergo puberty, or that the “gender-affirming” path has not been proven to resolve gender dysphoria in the long run, and results in permanent loss of fertility and serious long-term health risks. Such arguments were of no avail to the Ohio parents who lost custody of their teenage daughter because they would not allow her to begin hormone treatments to transition to a male gender identity. The combined legal and cultural impact of Bostock threatens to make such tragic cases increasingly common. The dangers of Bostock for parental rights are grave, but not entirely unavoidable. To avert these dangers, we need to take proactive steps to prepare for the challenges to come. Specifically, it is now more crucial than ever to oppose state and federal legislation like the Equality Act, which would further undermine the freedom of private and religious schools to hire in line with their mission and values, and mandate admittance to single-sex facilities and sports based on gender identity. Such legislation could even lead to court-mandated curricula promoting radical views of gender and sexuality in all public schools. Parents and all concerned citizens should tell their elected officials they want laws clarifying that single-sex sports and private facilities do not constitute discrimination, but rather are essential to maintain fairness and protect student privacy and safety."},

It’s coming at them not just from cultural forces in social media and entertainment, but from state governments and local school boards. Now, the White House and Congress are poised to exacerbate these trends by infusing K-12 schools with destructive ideology, politicizing medicine, and undermining parental rights. On Day One of his administration, President Joe Biden signed a divisive transgender executive order that forces all K-12 public schools in the nation that accept federal funds to adopt sexual orientation and gender identity policies. Such policies allow students to participate in single-sex sports and use single-sex facilities that don’t match their biological sex, such as bathrooms and locker rooms. Those policies destroy opportunities for female athletes and deprive students of privacy and safety. This week, the Democrat-controlled Congress announced its intention to permanently impose sexual orientation and gender identity ideology on the nation by voting on the Equality Act in the House next week. Every person should be treated with dignity and respect, and no one should be discriminated against simply because they identify as gay or transgender. But the Equality Act will turn disagreements over biological sex and marriage into legal “discrimination.” In the states, sexual orientation and gender identity laws and policies have already led to the punishment of doctors and hospitals who don’t want to perform surgical interventions to affirm gender identity and of teachers who don’t use “preferred pronouns.” It has harmed girls who have lost sports competitions and scholarships to males who “identify” as females. In one school, a kindergarten girl was the victim of sexual assault by a boy who was allowed into the girls restroom after “identifying” as gender-fluid. State lawmakers and parents have tried to fight back. But by cementing transgender ideology into federal law, the Equality Act will serve as a modern Trojan horse in medicine and education, causing irreversible harms to children. For this reason, parents and lawmakers are rallying around the “Promise to America’s Children.” The 10 principles of the promise unite concerned citizens and lawmakers in protecting children’s minds and bodies, and relationships with their parents. The promise begins with the pledge to protect children’s minds from graphic sexual content and the sexual orientation and gender identity agenda in the classroom by demanding that any curricula related to sex or gender, in any subject, require an opt-in from parents. If passed, the Equality Act would open the door for K-12 curricula to include controversial information, such as suggesting that a girl can be trapped in a boy’s body or vice versa and that “gender transition” is both healthy and helpful. By adding sexual orientation and gender identity to Title IV and Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Equality Act could pressure K-12 schools and federally funded colleges and universities to adopt the sexual orientation and gender identity curricula and preferred pronoun policies. After 1964, federal courts ordered public schools to teach black history to remedy discrimination against African Americans. In like fashion, federal courts could also order schools to teach the sexual orientation and gender identity curricula. Students deserve to learn in a classroom where they and their views are treated with respect. Imposing one political viewpoint on students on questions about gender and sexual orientation stigmatizes those who hold disfavored views. According to Mary Hasson of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, “An education environment that, implicitly or explicitly, labels or treats students as ‘bigoted’ because of their beliefs denies that child the right to a supportive educational environment, effectively denying them meaningful access to the right to an education.” The Promise to America’s Children recognizes that biological differences between the sexes are integral to the personhood and health of all children. Gender dysphoria (the distress someone experiences when they have a disconnect between their bodily sex and internal sense of gender) is a serious condition that should be treated with humane and compassionate responses. The promise defends a child’s chance to be affirmed in his or her body. Among children who struggle with gender dysphoria, 80% to 95% of those who are allowed to mature naturally through puberty tend to resolve their dysphoria. In contrast, those who undergo physical “transition” interventions, such as puberty blockers and other irreversible surgeries, often do not see any lasting benefits with regards to mental health. In fact, many patients experience permanent damage to their cardiovascular health, bone density, and reproductive functions. Contrary to the science, the Equality Act would make physical “transition” interventions standard medical care for gender-dysphoric minors. Puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones could be offered at as young as 9 years old. After receiving these, minors could then undergo irreversible “top” or “bottom” surgery. By expanding the definition of “public accommodations” under Title II of the Civil Rights Act to include health care establishments, as well as changing federal assistance requirements under Title VI of that law, the Equality Act would make counselors and medical professionals who do not “affirm” self-professed gender identity liable to discrimination claims. As a result, evidence-based treatments that have been proven to help children reconcile with their bodies would disappear. Medical providers who administered those treatments would be forced to choose between their consciences or performing interventions that they consider to be “bad medicine.” Parents will be left without therapeutic alternatives that do not cause irreversible harms to their children’s bodies. The promise recognizes that parents are the ones best suited to provide the love and care their children deserve. Unfortunately, the Equality Act places strain on this essential relationship by pitting parents against the education system, the medical profession, and federal law. Politicizing medicine has already begun to influence judges to question the decisions of parents who wanted to pursue counseling instead of hormonal or surgical interventions. Don’t believe it? In 2019, an Ohio judge removed a 17-year-old biological female from her parents’ custody after they refused to allow doctors to help her “transition” with testosterone. Contrary to the ideas in the Equality Act, the promise seeks to preserve the precious bond between parents and their children from this corrosive ideology. The Promise to America’s Children places the protection of children’s minds, bodies, and families first and foremost. A child’s best chance at a happy and healthy life is one free from sexual politics, one in which kids can be kids. Find out how you can support the promise and get involved here.

But not every bill that calls itself a compromise is a good compromise. And that, sadly, is the case with the so-called “Fairness for All” legislation introduced Friday. Over the past several years I’ve been in dialogue with the main scholars and civic leaders promoting and drafting this legislation (including participating in a conference on it at Yale Law School in 2017 and authoring a chapter on the approach—and suggesting a better approach—in a Cambridge University Press book published this year). I have reviewed the 69-page legislative draft over the past several weeks. Despite the undoubted good will of those who drafted and introduced the legislation, and despite some meaningful though insufficient protections for religious liberty, the bill is not in fact fair for all. Its protections for religious liberty come at the high cost of enshrining a misguided sexual and gender ideology into federal law. This will allow the federal government to use our civil rights laws as a sword to punish citizens who dissent from the reigning sexual orthodoxy. This is certain to create significant harm to the common good, especially for the privacy, safety, and equality of women and girls. The high costs of the Fairness for All compromise shouldn’t be surprising, because the compromise the bill sought was misframed from the beginning. In a letter to fellow lawmakers asking them to co-sponsor the bill, Rep. Chris Stewart, R-Utah, the lead sponsor, revealed why the compromise is flawed. Stewart writes that his bill is meant to be “a balanced legislative solution for preserving religious freedom and protecting LGBT civil rights.” But these aren’t the only two values at stake in this legislative area, so a compromise that is framed only between these two values is certain to leave out important considerations. Unsurprisingly, the bill introduced Friday does just that. Stewart argues that his bill will deliver “greater freedom for everyone by creating robust protections for religious individuals and organizations and comprehensively amending the Civil Rights Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity.” But elevating “sexual orientation and gender identity” to a protected class in the Civil Rights Act will cause serious harms. What Stewart fails to acknowledge, and what his bill fails to wrestle with, are the harms it would cause to people’s privacy, safety, equality, and other forms of liberty—not just for religious people, but for anyone who disagrees with contemporary sexual and gender ideology. A bill that was truly fair for all would not allow the government to use civil rights law as a sword to punish citizens for disagreement on sexual ideology. A bill that was truly fair would explicitly say that no institution could be forced by the government to allow boys who identify as girls to compete against girls in athletics; that no institution could be forced by the government to allow men who identify as women into women-only spaces, such as locker rooms and shelters; that no institution could be penalized because it lives out its creed that marriage unites a husband and wife. A bill that was truly fair for all would explicitly say that no physician would have to engage in any “gender-affirming” care that they thought unethical, and that no child could be denied assistance to help them identify with their bodies. And yet, to take just one example, Fairness for All says that an “entity unlawfully discriminates against a child by” treating a child “inconsistently with the child’s gender identity,” and by providing the child with “any practice or treatment that seeks to change the child’s … gender identity.” So children must be affirmed in their gender confusion, and adults may not attempt to help them—all in the name of fairness. The bill limits these provisions to foster children and others in custody of the state. But if this is what “fairness” requires for those children, why not for all children? These outcomes are unsurprising given that the goal was to protect only religious liberty, not advance the totality of the common good. Real fairness for all would protect people who identify as LGBT from truly unjust discrimination while explicitly stating that acting on the conviction that we are created male and female, and that male and female are created for each other, isn’t discriminatory. And so it would also protect people who hold those convictions and their freedom to act on them in the public square. Not only does Fairness for All misframe the policy arena as one between “LGBT rights” and “religious liberty,” but it fails to precisely target the needs of LGBT-identifying people that require a policy solution. In a press release supporting Fairness for All, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints argued that “No American should lose their home or job simply for being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender.” That’s true. But the Fairness for All legislation goes well beyond cases where people are fired or evicted simply for identifying as LGBT. Fairness for All takes the existing Civil Rights Act of 1964, which was passed by Congress to, among other things, combat racism, and expands its reach while adding “sexual orientation and gender identity” as protected classes. The bill never defines what constitutes discrimination against such classes. So it takes a law meant to combat racism, broadens its reach, and fails to define a key term. But properly defining unjust discrimination and targeting legislation at those actions is essential. Part of the problem with Fairness for All is that it leaves it entirely at the whim of hostile bureaucrats and judges to declare that commonsense actions may count as discrimination. What exactly would the proposed ban on “discrimination” on the basis of “gender identity” entail? Can the bill’s drafters and sponsors tell us what elevating gender identity to a protected class in civil rights law will mean long term? Can they even tell us what it would legally require today? It is irresponsible to rewrite our civil rights laws to make “gender identity” a protected class when we can’t even define what gender identity is, or how many there are. According to the most up-to-date gender theory, gender identity exists along a spectrum and can be fluid. Possible gender identities include “boy/girl,” “gender-hybrid,” and “gender ambidextrous.” How is it fair for all to pass a law saying it’s illegal to discriminate on the basis of these gender identities without even defining what constitutes discrimination? This is legislative malpractice and will lead to endless, costly litigation. Activists currently claim that combating gender identity discrimination requires new bathroom, athletic, pronoun, and health care policies mandating “gender affirmation” care. But when you consider the fact that most Americans hadn’t even heard the phrase “gender identity” five years ago, it seems premature to suggest that elevating it to a protected class status is what “fairness for all” requires. Now is not the time to rush to conclusions, but to think critically and prudently. In the midst of the redefinitions of marriage, sex, and gender, all Americans—wherever they fall on the political spectrum and whether they are religious, secular, or agnostic—should join the effort to find ways to coexist peacefully. Fairness for All would not achieve this goal. Instead, it would treat reasonable disagreement as if it were discrimination, impose sexual and gender ideology, and penalize those who dissent. But that doesn’t mean we need to succumb to an endless culture war. While Fairness for All is an unsuccessful legislative compromise, we should still work to develop good legislation. A better approach would carefully consider the needs of people who identify as LGBT that require a policy response, and then target legislation at those needs. Such legislation would specifically define what constitutes unlawful behavior, while explicitly protecting everyone’s freedom to engage in legitimate actions based on the conviction that we are created male and female, and that male and female are created for each other. Such legislation must protect the privacy and safety of women and girls, the conscience rights of doctors and other medical professionals, parental rights, and the free speech and religious liberty rights of countless professionals. This would leave all Americans free to act on those convictions. It would also protect diversity and promote tolerance. It would promote true fairness for all."},

This isn’t the first time Biden has made known the priority he has placed on the Equality Act. Soon after winning big in the March 3 Super Tuesday Democratic presidential primaries, he released an extensive plan “to advance LGBTQ+ equality in America and around the world.” The plan, which would require America’s institutions to “enforce [LGBT] rights,” would be harmful to religious liberty and to the rights of women, parents, and children. The plan makes signing the Equality Act into law a key priority. The legislation passed the House of Representatives a year ago on May 17, 2019, and is one of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s top priorities. It would add “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” as protected classes under the Civil Rights Act, categories that the authors of the law would not have had in mind when it passed Congress in 1964. This change to the Civil Rights Act would impact everyday Americans’ liberty, privacy, and parental and individual rights in numerous ways. One of the first groups that would be affected would be charities—specifically, faith-based adoption agencies and homeless shelters. Recent action by the current administration and proposals in Congress have sought to provide protections for those organizations. The Department of Health and Human Services has proposed a rule to allow faith-based adoption agencies to exercise their religious beliefs in placing children only in loving homes with a father and a mother. The Child Welfare Provider Inclusion Act, introduced by Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., would codify this protection of faith-based agencies into law. If adopted, the plan and the Equality Act would repeal the current administration’s rule and shut down agencies that refuse to violate their deeply held beliefs, preventing the placement of thousands of children with a caring father and mother. The Equality Act and similar proposals would also threaten homeless shelters that arrange their housing according to biological sex. In Alaska, a biological man who “identifies” as a woman attempted to enter the Hope Center, a shelter for abused women. Since the women share bathroom facilities and sleep near each other, the shelter refused to admit him. He later filed a complaint for “gender identity discrimination.” The current administration has proposed a rule to protect shelters such as the Hope Center, which desire to respect the privacy of women in their care, but even that would also be reversed by LGBT activists’ proposals. Their radical agenda would also extend to the criminal justice system. It would require prisons to make housing assignments based on the gender identity of the inmate. In the United Kingdom, where a similar law is already in place, a male rapist was transferred to a women’s prison because he “identifies” as a woman. Once there, he twice committed sexual assaults. Taxpayers also would be responsible for paying for sex-change procedures of transgender inmates. The plan promises to “ensure all transgender inmates in federal correctional facilities have access to appropriate doctors and medical care—including OB-GYNs and hormone therapy.” The health care sector also would be substantially affected by these proposals. The plan “will ensure that LGBTQ+ individuals have full access to all appropriate health care treatments and resources.” That includes taxpayer-funded hormone treatments and sex-change surgery for transgender individuals through the Affordable Care Act. It would also affect privacy, safety, and fairness for children in public schools. It promises to reinstate the Obama administration’s guidance that required schools to allow students who identify as transgender to access the bathrooms and locker rooms of the opposite sex. That guidance rightly has been revoked by the current administration. If reinstated, the privacy of all students would be compromised, and even leave them vulnerable to sexual assault, as was the case in one notable case in Georgia. Girls would be at a disadvantage on their own sports teams, as biological males would be able to compete against them. Two males in Connecticut, who “identify” as female, easily took first and second place in a girls track and field state competition, and such a policy would be mandatory nationwide under the Equality Act and related policies. The legislation would force business owners to conform to new sexual norms, or they would be at risk of losing their business. Bakers, florists, photographers, and wedding venue owners who support traditional values would have to choose between participating in same-sex weddings or closing their business. Jack Phillips, the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop in Colorado, went all the way to the Supreme Court over declining to bake a same-sex wedding cake. The court acknowledged his right to exercise his deeply held religious beliefs in a 7-2 decision, but the Equality Act and the plan would steamroll this affirmation of religious liberty. The plan also proposes a nationwide ban on “conversion therapy,” possibly including even counseling by clergy. That would particularly harm children experiencing gender dysphoria, as research shows that 80% to 95% of children resolve their distress if not pushed to transition socially or medically. Counseling bans would prevent those children from seeking any help to accept their bodies other than the activist-approved path of puberty blockers and hormones. The plan rightly states that “every human being should be treated with respect and dignity.” The problem is that it would not protect all Americans. Only when the rights of women, children, and parents are protected and religious liberty is respected will there be genuine “equality for all.”"},

"], "text": "A decade ago, President Barack Obama affirmed that marriage unites a man and woman. So did 45 states and the federal government. The only states to redefine marriage had done so through activist court rulings or, in 2009, legislative action. At the ballot box, citizens had uniformly voted against redefinition. A majority agreed with Obama. Then, in 2012, Obama “evolved,” and the Supreme Court took cases involving marriage law. Nothing in the Constitution answered the actual question at hand: What is marriage? The court should have left the issue to the people. But in 2013, it struck down the federal definition of marriage as a male-female union in a 5-4 ruling. The court also punted on a challenge to a state definition of marriage adopted in a 2008 constitutional referendum by which a majority of Californians—yes, Californians—overturned an activist court. Only in 2015 did the Supreme Court, breaking 5-4 again, redefine marriage for the nation, provoking four irrefutable dissents. Same-sex marriage advocates told the public that they sought only the “freedom to marry.” Same-sex couples were already free to live as they chose, but legal recognition was about the definition of marriage for all of society. It was about affirmation—by the government and everyone else. It was never really about “live and let live”—that was a merely tactical stance. It’s unsurprising that once a campaign that used to cry “live and let live” prevailed, it began working to shut down Catholic adoption agencies and harass evangelical bakers and florists. This shows it was never really about “live and let live”—that was a merely tactical stance. While these were the early effects of redefinition, the more profound consequences will be to marriage itself. Law shapes culture; culture shapes beliefs; beliefs shape action. The law now effectively teaches that mothers and fathers are replaceable, that marriage is simply about consenting adult relationships, of whatever formation the parties happen to prefer. This undermines the truth that children deserve a mother and a father—one of each. It also undercuts any reasonable justification for marital norms. After all, if marriage is about romantic connection, why require monogamy? There’s nothing magical about the number two, as defenders of “polyamory” point out. If marriage isn’t a conjugal union uniting a man and a woman as one flesh, why should it involve or imply sexual exclusivity? If it isn’t a comprehensive union inherently ordered to childbearing and rearing, why should it be pledged to permanence? The law now effectively teaches that mothers and fathers are replaceable, that marriage is simply about consenting adult relationships, of whatever formation the parties happen to prefer. Marriage redefiners could not answer these questions when challenged to show that the elimination of sexual complementarity did not undermine other marital norms. Today, they increasingly admit that they have no stake in upholding norms of monogamy, exclusivity, and permanence. Same-sex marriage didn’t create these problems. Many in America had unwisely already gone along with the erosion of marital norms in the wake of the sexual revolution—with the rise of cohabitation, nonmarital childbearing, no-fault divorce, and the hookup culture. It was no surprise that many would then question the relevance of the male-female norm. Legal redefinition is a consequence of the cultural breakdown of marriage. >>>Why the Declining Marriage Rate Affects Everyone But same-sex marriage is a catalyst for further erosion. Already, we see respectable opinion-makers mainstreaming “throuples,” “ethical nonmonogamy” and “open relationships.” This was predictable; we and others predicted it. Something we didn’t predict are the headlines about transgender and nonbinary “identities.” A decade ago, few Americans had given much thought to the “T” in “LGBT.” Today, transgender identity seems to dominate the discussion of sexuality and sexual morality. There’s a logic here. If we can’t see the point of our sexual embodiment where it matters most—in marriage—we’ll question whether it matters at all. Hence the push to see gender as “fluid” and existing along a “spectrum” of nonbinary options. There’s a deeper logic, too. Implicit in the push for same-sex marriage was body-self dualism—the idea that we’re actually nonphysical entities inhabiting physical bodies, or ghosts in machines. That’s why the “plumbing” in sexual acts seemed not to matter. True one-flesh union, the foundation of conjugal marriage, was thought illusory. What mattered was emotional union and partners’ use of their bodies to induce desirable sensations and feelings. Of course, two men or two women (or throuples or even larger sexual ensembles) could do that. But the logic didn’t stay with marriage. If the body is mere plumbing, then sex matters less than identity. This has had tragic consequences, especially for children. Nearly unthinkable a decade ago, certain medical professionals tell children experiencing gender dysphoria that they are trapped in the wrong body, even that their bodies are merely like Pop-Tarts foil packets, as one expert explained. Nearly unthinkable a decade ago, certain medical professionals tell children experiencing gender dysphoria that they are trapped in the wrong body. Some doctors now prescribe puberty-blocking drugs to otherwise healthy children struggling to accept their bodies. They prescribe cross-sex hormones for young teens to transform their bodies to align with their gender identities. As part of a government grant-supported study, doctors even performed double mastectomies on adolescent girls—including two 13-year-olds. These changes weren’t grassroots movements. They’ve come from people wielding political, economic, and cultural power to advance sexual-liberationist ideology. The change has been top-down—from Hollywood’s portrayal of LGBT characters to business executives boycotting states over religious freedom laws. Having lost at the ballot box over and over—even in California—activists found new avenues: ideologically friendly courts, federal agencies, big corporations. Having secured a judicial redefinition of marriage, they pivoted to the “T,” with the Obama administration redefining “sex” to mean “gender identity” and imposing a new policy on all schools. The change has been top down—from Hollywood’s portrayal of LGBT characters to business executives boycotting states over religious-freedom laws. And having won government support, activists turned to eliminating private dissent. Former presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke wants to yank the tax-exemption of noncompliant churches. Megadonor Tim Gill vows to spend his fortunes to “punish the wicked.” Who are “the wicked”? Those who refuse to accept the new sexual orthodoxy. All of us, including those identifying as LGBT, are made in God’s image, are endowed with profound dignity and thus deserve respect. It’s because of this dignity and out of such respect that the institutions serving the human good—like the marriage-based family—should be supported, not undermined or redefined. That basic rights like religious freedom ought to be upheld, not infringed. That a healthy moral and physical ecology—especially for children—must be preserved. The “progress” of the past decade has exacted steep costs."},

He must refrain from writing what he believes—that there are only two sexes—and instead conform to the language of the times. The Denver Post tried to impose a modern form of Newspeak on him. He didn’t go along, and he was swiftly terminated. Following his firing, The Denver Post published a job opening for two opinion columnists. The paper said it was “looking for writers with strong voices, strong opinions,” and that it is “looking for both conservative and liberal writers.” The Post even added, “We do not have any type of political litmus test for our columnists.” Well, you can be the judge. Caldara is hardly the first person to face punishment for saying that sex is binary and rooted in biology. In 2018, Nicholas Meriwether of Shawnee State University addressed a student as “sir.” The student approached the professor after class and demanded he use feminine pronouns. Since this violated his religious convictions, the professor chose to address the student simply by a first or last name. But that wasn’t enough, and the school charged Meriwether with creating a “hostile environment.” A similar controversy erupted at a Virginia high school in 2018. The high school fired French teacher Peter Vlaming for not using male pronouns when addressing a biologically female student who identified as a male. Out of conscience, Vlaming asked the student’s if he could use a first or last name only. The student said no. These are not isolated incidents. They are all connected as parts of a larger trend of compelling speech. Compelled speech is even a threat coming from Congress. Speech could be compelled on a nationwide basis if the House-passed Equality Act is signed into law, making “gender identity” into a protected class under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. A leading proponent of the bill, LaLa Zannell, manager of the ACLU’s Trans Justice Campaign, said the Equality Act is important precisely because it would protect Americans who identify as transgender from harassment that includes misgendering. Compelled speech is not just an American problem. Last year, a 30-year veteran doctor in Britain was fired from the National Health Service for not calling a 6-foot man with a beard a “she.” The employment tribunal that heard his case said his belief that God created human beings male and female was “incompatible with human dignity.” That’s right. Holding fast to some of the most basic beliefs of history are now “incompatible with human dignity” and can cost you your job. Standing up to this censorship should not be a single-party issue. Both conservatives and liberals should agree that forcing someone to use language they believe to be untrue is unacceptable. Moreover, censorship is now affecting both sides of the political spectrum. Self-described socialist and feminist Meghan Murphy, for instance, was banned from Twitter in late 2018 for “misgendering” someone. “[W]e’re talking about free speech,” Murphy said, “and that’s a concept that everyone should support regardless of whether or not they’re on the left or the right.” Murphy’s fellow Canadian Jordan Peterson was one of the first to speak out against Canada’s compelled-speech policy. He noted that “[f]ree speech is not just another value. It’s the foundation of Western civilization.” The truth is that compelled speech doesn’t benefit anyone. The public square should be a battlefield of ideas where the only weapon is diplomacy through persuasion, not a sword of compulsion. Our Founding Fathers understood this, and so they enshrined the freedom of speech in the First Amendment. This is the cornerstone of our republic, and it is the envy of all those who live under repressive regimes. Immigrants from the former Soviet Union, Nazi Germany, and Maoist China did not seek refuge in the United States to have their speech compelled once again. The sword of compulsion must not be brought to the United States. Americans should not have to worry that they could lose their jobs if they do not agree with the politicized terminology of the day. Let us fight for the freedom of speech for all, and prevent Newspeak from gaining a foothold in the land of the free."},

Title VII prohibits an employer from failing or refusing “to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual … because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” Gorsuch—joined by the four liberal justices, along with Chief Justice John Roberts—decided that employment decisions that take any account of an employee’s sexual orientation or gender identity necessarily entail discrimination based on sex in violation of Title VII. In Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, which was combined with two other cases, Gorsuch wrote that the straightforward application of the terms in Title VII, according to their ordinary public meaning at the time of its enactment, means that an employer violates the law when it intentionally fires an individual based in part on sex. In a logical and legal leap, Gorsuch then argued that includes sexual orientation and gender identity, since those concepts are related to sex. Thus, Gorsuch reasoned, it means the employer is treating individuals differently because of their sex. An employer cannot escape liability by showing that it treats men and women comparably as groups. The employer has violated the law even if it subjects all male and female homosexual and transgender employees to the same treatment. Gorsuch dismissed as irrelevant the historical fact that none of the legislators who passed the Civil Rights Act in 1964 would have ever expected or contemplated that Title VII’s ban on employment discrimination on the basis of sex would apply to a man hired by a funeral home who then told his new employer, the R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Home, that he planned to “live and work full-time as a woman.” That was one of the three cases before the court. That provision of the 1964 law was intended to stop the blatant employment discrimination rampant against women at that time. The majority opinion by Gorsuch upending more than five decades of prior precedents was only 33 pages long. Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, filed a blistering dissent in which he said that “there is only one word for what the Court has done today: legislation.” He pointed out that the majority’s claim that it is “merely enforcing the terms of the statute” is “preposterous.” As Alito undisputedly says, “if every single American had been surveyed in 1964, it would have been hard to find any who thought that discrimination because of sex meant discrimination because of sexual orientation—not to mention gender identity, a concept that was essentially unknown at the time.” The majority tries to “pass off its decision” as just an application of the term “sex” in Title VII, claiming it is applying the textualism championed by the late Justice Antonin Scalia. But according to Alito, that claim and the majority’s opinion “is like a pirate ship.” He added: Alito said that the majority’s “arrogance” is “breathtaking,” since “there is not a shred of evidence that any Member of Congress interpreted the statutory text that way when Title VII was enacted.” Neither “sexual orientation,” nor “gender identity” appear on the list of five specified grounds for discrimination in Title VII, and the majority’s “argument is not only arrogant, it is wrong,” he wrote.  The terms “sex,” “sexual orientation,” and “gender identity” are “different concepts,” and neither of the two latter terms are “tied to either of the biological sexes.” Alito is, of course, entirely correct, as one of us pointed out in a recent article in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy. And, of course, Congress knew that “sex” didn’t include “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” Alito recalled that there have been numerous bills introduced in Congress over the past 45 years to amend the law and add those terms, but they all failed. The majority is “usurping the constitutional authority of the other branches” of government and has taken the latest congressional bill on this topic and “issued it under the guise of statutory interpretation.” Justice Brett Kavanaugh also filed a dissenting opinion, in which he wrote that “this case boils down to one fundamental question:  Who decides?” The issue is whether Title VII “should be expanded to prohibit discrimination because of sexual orientation,” he wrote, adding that responsibility “belongs to Congress and the President in the legislative process, not to this Court.” Kavanaugh lauded the “extraordinary vision, tenacity, and grit” of the gay and lesbian community for working “hard for many decades to achieve equal treatment in fact and in law.”  But, he added, under separation of powers, “it was Congress’s role, not this Court’s, to amend Title VII.” Alito made it clear that the “updating desire to which the Court succumbs no doubt rises from humane and generous impulses.” But the “authority of this Court is limited to saying what the law is.” In their dissents, Alito, Thomas, and Kavanaugh got it right, and the majority got it wrong. The word “sex”— still today as when Congress passed the Civil Rights Act in 1964—refers to our biological reality as male or female. It doesn’t refer to our sexual orientations or malleable gender identities as some see it. If those terms were contained within Title VII, there would have been no need for Congress to repeatedly try to amend the law to add sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes. In an act of judicial activism, a majority of the Supreme Court has simply legislated from the bench and amended the statute itself. Congress has not legislated such an outcome, and it was wrong for the court to usurp lawmakers’ authority by imposing such an extreme policy on our nation without the consent of the governed."},

To do that, however, they’d need to invent a time machine. Congress can’t amend a resolution that expired nearly four decades ago. But it’s easy to see why they’re resorting to such legislative sleight of hand. The ERA is more controversial than ever. The Constitution requires two-thirds of the House and Senate to propose an amendment, and three-quarters of the states to ratify it. The ERA was so contentious that, beginning in 1923, more than 1,100 resolutions to propose it were introduced in the House or Senate before one finally received enough congressional support in 1972. Getting even that far required the compromise of adding a seven-year ratification deadline. States initially jumped on board because of the ERA’s superficial appeal—who could be against equal rights, after all? Genuine scrutiny, however, stalled ratifications at 35 by January 1977, and led five of those states to withdraw their approval. Controversy continued when Congress passed a resolution in 1978 to add three more years for ratification. That resolution had only majority support, rather than the supermajority the Constitution requires, and in 1981 a federal court ruled the extension unconstitutional. No additional states ratified the ERA and, whether it took its final breath in 1979 or 1982, the ERA died. >>>The \"Equal Rights Amendment\" Virginia Just Ratified Is a Legal Fiction Like a zombie, though, it’s back. Decades after the ERA’s demise, advocates now claim they can resuscitate it and pick up where they left off. Three more states—Nevada in 2017, Illinois in 2018, and Virginia this year—actually claim they’ve ratified it. No More Mother’s Day The ERA’s backers are trying such gimmicks because they know that time has only made the ERA more controversial. Many statutes and regulations from government at all levels make distinctions between men and women. If, as the 1972 ERA states, “[e]quality of rights under the law” may not be abridged, or limited, “on account of sex,” every one of those distinctions would be open to constitutional challenge. Think that’s far-fetched? In 1977, while the 1972 ERA was pending before the states, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued a report titled “Sex Bias in the U.S. Code” with 230 pages of such provisions in federal statutes. The list even includes the law designating Mother’s and Father’s Day as separate holidays. The author was then-Professor Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Two decades later, now-Justice Ginsburg authored the Supreme Court’s opinion in United States v. Virginia holding unconstitutional single-sex education at the Virginia Military Institute. If the court could turn its sociological opinion into a constitutional mandate without the ERA, imagine what it could do with that explicit constitutional weapon. Then There’s Abortion and Transgenderism Then there’s abortion. During the House floor debate last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said it had “nothing to do with the abortion issue.” If you believe that, I have some ocean-front property in Utah to sell you. To ERA advocates, everything has to do with the abortion issue. In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court created a right to abortion based on the autonomy of women. Abortion advocates, however, have sought an alternative to Roe to keep the right to abortion alive (so to speak). Some believe that Roe itself is constitutionally defective. In a 1985 article, for example, Ginsburg argued that equality between women and men would be a stronger constitutional foundation for abortion rights. Others believe that state or federal statutes can fill the gap if the Supreme Court corrects its mistake and overturns Roe. Last year, New York state adopted a law not only legalizing abortion up to birth, but even denying legal protection to babies who survive abortion. On the federal level, the so-called “Women’s Health Protection Act” would prevent state or local governments from taking any steps to protect children from abortion. Unlike the “right” to privacy and abortion, which is not in the Constitution, the ERA would be. But the controversy does not stop there. Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination “because of sex.” In three current cases, advocates want the Supreme Court to redefine the word “sex,” which meant biological sex when Congress enacted Title VII, to also include sexual orientation and gender identity. What do think they will do when “on account of sex” pops up in a constitutional amendment? Then there’s a curious change in the ERA’s wording. In September 2013, for the first time, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) introduced a resolution to propose the ERA with a new first sentence: “Women shall have equal rights in the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction. Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.” What does that mean? The very first version of the ERA, introduced in Congress in 1923, read: “Men and women shall have equal rights throughout the United States and every place subject to its jurisdiction.” But what does it mean to say that women alone have equal rights? Equal with what? Maloney would not add this curious new sentence unless she believed it meant something different than the familiar “equality of rights” language. What’s going on here? These few examples, both old and new, are more than enough to make the point. The ERA has been controversial from the start, and is even more so today. Federal judges will need no more than an imagination and a political agenda to use the ERA for all sorts of mischief. And it looks like ERA advocates are still trying, under the “equal rights” cloak, to turn it into a way to force upon Americans policies and cultural changes that they would not choose for themselves. That’s no way to treat a Constitution."},

", "This could lead to greater legal restrictions on parents’ ability to make medical decisions for their own children. ", "Once again in the battle over transgender ideology, children will become the victims of adult political disputes. "], "text": "Utah recently codified an administrative rule that bans “any practice or treatment that seeks to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of a patient or client” under the age of 18. This made it the 19th state to ban the practice, frequently labeled “conversion therapy.” Some call this a milestone in protecting vulnerable children, but the reality is more complicated. Advocates describe so-called conversion therapy as a “discredited practice” linked to physical abuse, drug use, and suicide, and they point to politicized statements from medical associations and activist groups to support these claims. Although it is possible to find instances of physical abuse and otherwise clearly harmful practices which can and should be prosecuted under existing law, counseling bans such as the one enacted in Utah are not targeted at particular practices but instead at particular values. They impose a legal ban because the state disagrees with views about human sexuality and biology held by certain professionals. Utah’s ban includes an exemption for religious counselors and clergy members who are “acting substantially in a pastoral or religious capacity and not in the capacity of a mental health therapist.” This exemption was included to address objections to a previous version of the ban raised by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, to which more than three in five Utahans belong. The exact parameters of the exception are unclear, and LGBT activist groups frequently single out religious groups as being the main perpetrators of abusive “conversion therapy” practices. Counseling bans such as Utah’s have particularly troubling implications for minors struggling with gender dysphoria. When treating gender dysphoria in minors, many medical professionals and parents prefer to try to help them accept their bodies rather than medically alter them. This stands in contrast to the approach recommended by LGBT activists, which mandates immediate and unquestioning affirmation of a child’s stated gender identity. This can include a social transition consisting of a new wardrobe, name, and pronouns, and eventually a medical transition via puberty blockers at age 9, cross-sex hormones at 14, and sex-reassignment surgery at 18. These “medical treatments” can permanently sterilize children well before they are old enough to understand the lifelong implications, and they lack any solid medical or scientific support. There is strong evidence for the effectiveness of a “watchful waiting” approach to treating gender dysphoria in minors, allowing children time and space to come to terms with their biological sex rather than pursuing aggressive, permanent interventions. Research shows that 80%-95% of children who experience gender dysphoria but do not transition socially will see their distress resolve on its own over time. Those placed on the path of social transition go on to undergo medical transition in almost all cases, suggesting that unquestioning affirmation by adults of a child’s professed transgender identity becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Counseling bans such as Utah’s would prohibit the watchful waiting approach and classify anything other than affirmation of transgender ideology as an unlawful attempt to “change gender identity.” Many young people who formerly identified as transgender report that doctors and therapists directed them to hormonal and surgical interventions rather than helping them address the underlying causes of their gender dysphoria. One young woman who spent a year in transition reports that a therapist authorized her testosterone injections after only five total hours of counseling, and the doctor who prescribed the hormones did not even open the letter containing the therapist’s authorization. She went on to suffer debilitating physical and mental side effects and eventually chose to detransition. Under Utah’s new rule, stories like this will become even more common as patients lose access to counseling that could steer them away from unnecessary hormone treatments and surgeries. When the state takes away choices from doctors, parents lose as well. This could lead to greater legal restrictions on parents’ ability to make medical decisions for their own children. In Ohio, for example, parents lost custody of their daughter in part because they wanted to pursue counseling rather than hormone treatments for her gender dysphoria. Once again in the battle over transgender ideology, children will become the victims of adult political disputes. Exploring the underlying causes of a child’s discomfort with his or her biological sex or providing body-affirming counseling is not a “discredited” or “abusive” practice. Utah’s attempt to ban this kind of counseling raises an important question for policymakers and activists: Which is a better definition of “conversion therapy”—talk therapy that helps a girl who doesn’t conform to traditional gender norms accept her body, or injecting her with testosterone and providing her with a double mastectomy because she doesn’t want to wear dresses or play with dolls?"},

Commission on the Status of Women was supposed to kick off this week, flooding Turtle Bay in Manhattan with feminists and advocates of every stripe. The event draws delegates from around the world and thousands of representatives from nongovernmental organizations to New York each March to discuss issues that affect women and girls. The threat of COVID-19, however, and the recommendation of the U.N. secretary-general caused the commission to meet for a scaled-down, one-day meeting Monday instead, disappointing many. This year’s commission meeting was set to mark the 25th anniversary of the landmark 4th World Conference on Women and resulting Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, held in Beijing in 1995. Certainly no one was more disappointed by the change of plans than the radical feminists and abortion advocates who were eager to seize the opportunity of this year’s meeting to further their efforts to make so-called “safe abortion” universally acceptable and to entrench the controversial notions of “sexual and reproductive health and rights” and “comprehensive sexuality education” into the ever-growing panoply of progressive human rights. But the Commission on the Status of Women was by no means the only thing on their agenda this year. U.N. Women has launched a campaign called “Generation Equality” to guide its actions through this anniversary year and is organizing Generation Equality forums this summer in Mexico City and Paris ahead of the high-level meeting of the U.N. General Assembly in September, which likely will pass a resolution to mark Beijing+25. These Generation Equality events appear to be following the model of the highly controversial Nairobi Summit, which the United Nations Population Fund held in Nairobi, Kenya, last year, circumventing the U.N.’s legitimate review conference process, which includes member-state negotiations and consensus building. The Nairobi Summit demonstrated the deep pockets and far-reaching goals of the dangerous alliance between the abortion industry and the international development complex that conditions foreign aid and development assistance on population control and abortion policies, raising pledges of more than $9 billion. Generation Equality lists “bodily autonomy” and “sexual and reproductive health and rights” among its demands, and further perpetuates the dangerous and insulting notions that women’s equality requires abortion rights and that women’s diverse needs can be reduced to sexual and reproductive issues. Pro-life women can’t let radical feminists dominate the agenda for women’s equality. Certainly, gender inequality still exists throughout the world. But to achieve greater equality for women and girls, we must be guided by a proper understanding of both “gender” and “equality.” Progressives at home and abroad, and even within U.N. Women, the organization within the U.N. system ostensibly devoted to women and girls, now routinely endeavor to redefine gender to include “gender identity” and countless new gender categories. But gender has historically referred to male and female, and must continue to do so, primarily to protect women and girls. Equality between the sexes must take into account the reality that men and women are different. Gender equality must mean that we are equal in dignity, equal in opportunity, and equal before the law, and not that we are the same. For the good of women and girls worldwide, we should not pursue a goal of gender equality that would seek to erase the differences between men and women. Yes, as Hillary Clinton famously said, “women’s rights are human rights,” because women, of course, are fully human. But women’s rights should never be defined to include abortion, because there is no right to kill an innocent human life, and abortion is a violation of the dignity of both mother and baby. Pro-life advocates from around the world made sure to avoid that mistake 25 years ago, when world leaders convened in Cairo for the International Conference on Population and Development, and then in Beijing, to negotiate and adopt the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. As there was in 1995, there is still much upon which we should all be able to agree: Women and girls around the world still need improved access to education, justice, and legal rights. They need sound medical care, good nutrition, and clean water. Many still suffer violence, coercion, and discrimination. Furthermore, more than 100 million girls have been killed in the womb as victims of sex-selective abortion. It’s hard to imagine a greater threat to girls worldwide. \n\nThe U.S. must continue to act as a leader internationally to improve the lives of women and girls, and simultaneously to protect and defend the unborn. The Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative and the U.S. Strategy on Women, Peace, and Security are two recent examples of measures the U.S. has taken that are targeted specifically at addressing women’s needs. The U.S. is the largest donor of bilateral reproductive health and family-planning assistance, while taking increasingly strong measures to ensure that U.S. funding does not go to entities that promote or perform abortions, thanks to the Trump administration’s Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy and the long-standing Helms Amendment. In international forums, the Trump administration has boldly and consistently insisted that there is no international right to abortion and is leading a coalition of countries to join in opposition to U.N. entities that have been stealthily trying to create one. Now is the time for President Donald Trump to create a pro-life ambassador-at-large position within the State Department to spearhead such efforts and to work in cooperation with the ambassador at large for global women’s issues, showing the world that the U.S. is proudly pro-life and pro-woman."},

As long as there have been armies, there have been military entrance criteria. For example, in the Civil War, recruits had to have a sufficient number of teeth to be able to tear open paper rifle musket cartridges. Today because of the needs and sophistication of the U.S. military, the requirements are lengthier and more complex. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, around 71 percent of young Americans are unable to meet the entrance criteria for today’s volunteer force. Some are ineligible due to educational or legal issues, but most of the reasons pertain to health. A shocking 27 percent of young Americans are too overweight to serve. Another 32 percent have other disqualifying conditions such as asthma, poor eyesight, mental health issues, or shoulder issues. Individuals who need constant medication or follow-on treatment to deal with ongoing medical issues are also ineligible. Why? Because in the military, you literally place your life into the hands of your comrades. You count on the man or woman to your left and right to carry out their tasks—to bring ammo, carry a stretcher, co-pilot an aircraft, or stand watch on a ship.  If they are unable—or even not at their best—lives are lost. Similarly, in deployed situations, a constant flow of medications or reliable access to medical care cannot be guaranteed. Hence, someone who needs that level of care presents a risk, both to themselves and their unit. To steal a football analogy, everyone needs to be able to play a position on the field, there are no “safe” jobs. For those in the military, dealing with stress is a constant, and troops must develop means to cope.   Service members spend long periods away from family, friends and home. Conditions are often austere, and when deployed, dangerous. Tragically, suicide rates among military members are already too high, recently surpassing the U.S. average. For these reasons, the military should be extraordinarily careful to prevent individuals who are already predisposed to stress injury to enter. This brings us to a current debate: What if there was a medical condition proven to cause those who suffer from it extraordinary stress, to the point that these individuals attempt suicide at nine times the general U.S. population? Similarly, individuals with this condition report experiencing serious psychological distress at eight times the rate of the U.S. population. And suppose, Defense Department records reflect that service members diagnosed with this condition are nine times more likely than those without it to seek mental health help from a medical professional. For the reasons described above, you would assume that someone with this condition—like those with severe depression or bipolar disorder—would be ineligible to join the military. But what if the condition is gender dysphoria, the medically recognized condition where individuals experience severe discomfort with their biological sex, resulting in significant distress or difficulty functioning. For about a year at the end of the Obama administration, all restrictions on service by those with gender dysphoria were lifted, but in 2018, after an exhaustive study of the issue, Defense Secretary James Mattis implemented the current policy, historically allowing service by transgender individuals, but wisely preventing those individuals suffering from gender dysphoria from enlisting. In late June, Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, introduced an amendment to the 2021 defense authorization bill to extend Supreme Court workplace protections against sex discrimination to the military overturning DoD’s current policy.  And Wednesday, over 100 House Democrats sent a letter to Defense Secretary Mark Esper advocating for the current policy to be overturned. Reversing the policy may have ideological appeal, but in actual practice, it would diminish the readiness of the armed forces and place individuals who are not psychologically prepared in situations likely to cause them harm. Members of the military count on Congress to have their backs and act in their best interest of readiness.  While this proposal may please some external advocacy groups, responsible leadership requires Congress to understand that this proposal represents a path towards weakening our military at the same time it finds itself faced with increasing threats throughout the world. The current policy was crafted to allow those who are free from gender dysphoria to serve while protecting those who may be harmed by military service. It ensures long-term military readiness, strikes the right balance for our country, and should be maintained."},

As a former teacher and a supporter of children’s charities, Rowling also stated her discomfort with the rush to medically transition children with gender dysphoria and especially the massive increase in young girls suddenly identifying as transgender. Despite the vitriol she received in response from the left, Rowling refused to back down from her stance. The comments by Rowling, along with other recent developments in the United Kingdom, show promising signs that the relentless advance of transgender ideology in medicine and public policy finally might be encountering some resistance across the Atlantic. This spring, Minister for Women and Equalities Liz Truss in Britain announced plans to ban sex-change procedures for anyone under the age of 18. She told a parliamentary committee on April 20, “I believe strongly that adults should have the freedom to lead their lives as they see fit, but I think it’s very important that while people are still developing their decision-making capabilities that we protect them from making those irreversible decisions.” Transgender activists frequently recommend those medical interventions—which include puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgery—for children who suffer from gender dysphoria. Parents of children questioning their biological sex are advised to unquestioningly affirm the child’s new, self-identified gender and help them to transition socially with the help of a new name, pronouns, and wardrobe. Little attention is paid to the adverse effects of that treatment, however. As Ryan T. Anderson and Robert P. George have written, such interventions “should be prohibited.” Activists have frequently brushed off concerns about possible regret following gender transitions, ignoring evidence that shows that they carry a number of physical and psychological risks. The use of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones can lead to increased cancer risk, decreased bone density, and adverse effects on brain development. In addition, hormones and surgeries can sterilize children who would normally be considered far too young to make such a serious—and permanent—medical decision. In contrast, a “watchful waiting” approach allows children time to accept their biological sex instead of rushing to alter it and can help address any underlying issues causing the distress. Studies show that 80% to 95% of children experiencing gender dysphoria who do not transition eventually come to accept their bodies, while nearly all children who are placed on the path of social transition go on to pursue medical interventions. The U.K.’s decision to prevent those under 18 from being subjected to those unproven procedures demonstrates the importance of considering the best medical and scientific evidence, even if it contradicts the activists’ narrative. Britain’s National Health Service recently made another change related to its treatment of gender dysphoria in minors. The Health Service’s website, which provides information about medical conditions and treatment, includes a section on gender dysphoria in children. A section on the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues to prevent puberty in children who identify as transgender previously stated, “The effects of treatment with GnRH analogues are considered to be fully reversible, so treatment can usually be stopped at any time.” That’s a common talking point for transgender activists, often employed to support early transitions while avoiding discussion of detrimental side effects or the lack of medical evidence supporting the use of puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria. Surprisingly, that section on the National Health Service website was recently updated to read: Rowling noted those concerns in a tweet, writing, “Many health professionals are concerned that young people struggling with their mental health are being shunted towards hormones and surgery when this may not be in their best interests.” The National Health Service site also notes that the use of cross-sex hormones can lead to irreversible physical changes, such as deepening of the voice in females and breast development in males, as well as permanent infertility. The changes to its site were made without fanfare, suggesting that the Health Service still fears activists’ outrage against even reasonable medical cautions. Despite its own update, the Health Service continues to recommend and administer these medical treatments to minors. The Minister for Women and Equalities’ report on banning some of those treatments is not expected until later this summer, and its exact recommendations remain to be seen. The changes to the Health Service’s website and the minister’s comments provide reason to hope that they will move toward a more cautious approach to treating children with gender dysphoria, protecting vulnerable youth from rushed, ideologically motivated—and often irreversible—interventions. Policymakers in the United States would be well advised to do the same."},

"], "text": "The past two weeks brought welcome rulings from the Supreme Court on religious liberty. We should celebrate these victories, because religious liberty is an authentic natural and human right. But it’s not enough. And even the best of religious liberty wins can’t adequately contend in a proxy war over substantive issues. We must do more politically to protect human flourishing and the authentic common good. This is particularly true with respect to the Court’s Bostock ruling, which read progressive gender ideology into our nation’s civil rights laws. A good ruling on the ministerial exception in Our Lady of Guadalupe, while important, does not even begin to address the many concerns there. Religious liberty, after all, doesn’t protect people who aren’t religious but reject progressive gender ideology. It doesn’t protect other goods and interests threatened by progressive gender ideology. And it doesn’t respond on the merits to the underlying disputed questions of truth. We need a more holistic response in terms of legislation and litigation to protect all people and all the various goods and interests at stake. We need to contend about the truth of the matter. Before turning to that, consider the three recent Supreme Court religious liberty victories. First, in Espinoza, the Court struck down the application of the notoriously anti-Catholic Blaine Amendments as applied to public funding for private education. As the Court ruled, the Constitution doesn’t require funding for private education, but if the government opts to fund students attending private schools, it can’t exclude those attending religious schools just for being religious. The Court’s logic is likely to apply to all government funding—the government can’t exclude a group simply because it’s religious from funding for which it would otherwise be eligible. Second, in Little Sisters, the Court ruled that the Trump administration had the authority to protect the religious liberty of the Little Sisters of the Poor from the Obamacare HHS mandate on contraceptives and abortifacients. And third, that same day, the Court ruled in Our Lady of Guadalupe that the constitutional doctrine known as the ministerial exception provides broad protections for religious schools to make staffing decisions for themselves based on their own religious criteria. The details in all of these cases are important, but we need not dig too deeply into them now. For even on the most generous and expansive readings possible, these rulings—while correct, good, and important—are not sufficient. Nor, I should note, are they intended to be. Why Aren’t These Wins Enough? Take, for example, the school choice victory. As important as protecting equal access to government funding for religious schools is, it does nothing to address what is going on at the government-run schools we call “public.” If the public schools are indoctrinating students with the Gender Unicorn, allowing access to single-sex facilities based on “gender identity,” and forcing girls to compete athletically against boys who identify as girls, equal access to government funding (when it exists) isn’t enough. It’s not enough for the vast majority of American children—including the majority of religious children—who are trapped in our public school system. Likewise, the ruling in favor of the Trump administration’s protections for the Little Sisters is a significant win. But the unjust mandate still exists. The states that sued the Trump administration will continue to do so—indeed, the attorney general of Pennsylvania has already announced that he will. And, as soon as the Trump administration leaves office and an administration hostile to religious liberty comes to DC, the regulations protecting the Little Sisters will likely be watered down or simply eliminated. Even today, under the Trump administration, the federal government tells employers their healthcare plans must provide cost-free coverage of twenty contraceptives, four of which carry FDA labels saying they can cause an early abortion. Our government is mandating the coverage of pills that can kill unborn babies. That’s not merely a religious liberty issue. And in the not too distant future, the safe harbor protecting those who object to this mandate is likely to be eliminated. Indeed, Joe Biden responded to the Little Sisters’ win by stating, “If I am elected, I will restore the Obama-Biden policy that existed before the Hobby Lobby ruling.” Finally, consider the ruling on the ministerial exception. It’s a great ruling, protecting the ability of religious institutions to continue their missions by staffing with people who share those missions. In that sense, it potentially limits some of the damage from Bostock’s redefinition of sex to include “sexual orientation” and “gender identity.” The ministerial exception likely protects a religious school from being forced to employ teachers who reject the virtue of chastity by engaging in same-sex sexual conduct, entering same-sex unions, or adopting a “gender identity” at odds with their bodies, if the school judges such activity to be contrary to their religious teaching and mission. Yet even here, there will likely be costly litigation to achieve these legal victories, and the litigation process will be part of the punishment. Even worse, Bostock still governs everywhere else, including religious employers of non-ministerial employees (where Title VII’s own religious staffing provisions will be litigated), and all non-religious employers. Will it now be employment discrimination in benefits if the healthcare plan that the religious owners of a retail arts and crafts store offer to employees does not cover testosterone therapy for their female employees who identify as men but does cover it for male employees with low testosterone? Will we need a lengthy and costly RFRA battle to find out? Furthermore, activists are likely to sue to extend the logic of Bostock to other areas of law that forbid discrimination on the basis of sex, such as education, housing, and healthcare. And in all of these areas, religious liberty isn’t the only—or even the primary—concern. Limiting the Harm of Bostock Beyond Religious Liberty While the ministerial exception does nothing for student conduct policies at religious schools, Title IX itself contains a religious exemption, so many religious schools’ campus policies could be protected from the logic of Bostock. But what about non-religious schools? What about shelters for homeless—or abused—women? What about medicine? The simplistic logic of the Gorsuch opinion in Bostock suggests some pretty bad outcomes in these situations. Here’s how Gorsuch summarizes his own test: Now change the word “employer” to teacher, principal, coach, doctor, healthcare plan, or homeless shelter, and change the word “employee” to student, athlete, patient, or housing guest. “If the coach relies on the athlete’s sex—if changing the athlete’s sex would yield a different choice…” “If the homeless shelter relies on the guest’s sex—if changing the guest’s sex would yield a different choice…” The outcomes don’t look very good. Privacy and safety at a shelter, equality on an athletic field, and good medicine are at stake for everyone—religious or not. We can—and should—resist Gorsuch’s simplistic logic. And we can—and should—defend commonsense policies that take seriously the bodily differences that provide valid bases in some areas of life (locker and shower rooms, athletics, women’s shelters, healthcare) for treating males and females differently (yet still equally). An unstated, frequently unexplored aspect of any “discrimination” claim is that two instances be “comparable,” that the two employees, or athletes, or patients, or shelter guests be “similarly situated.” Perhaps in the employment context Gorsuch couldn’t see this, but health, education, and housing provide starker instances. Start with health. Consider a case where a patient accuses a doctor or hospital or healthcare plan of “discrimination” because they won’t perform or offer or pay for breast removal as part of a “gender transition” procedure. The first thing to note is that Gorsuch’s test “if changing the patient’s sex would have yielded a different choice by the doctor” doesn’t apply. Change the patient’s sex and there are no breasts to remove. Indeed, as I point out in When Harry Became Sally, recognizing differences between the sexes is increasingly regarded as vitally important for good medical practice, because scientists have found that male and female bodies tend to be susceptible to certain diseases in different ways, to differing degrees, and that they respond to treatments differently. These differences do not have to do with how people choose to “identify.” They have to do with what men and women are: males or females of the human species. The Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences published a report in 2001 titled “Exploring the Biological Contributions to Human Health: Does Sex Matter?” The executive summary answered the question in the affirmative, saying that the explosive growth of biological information “has made it increasingly apparent that many normal physiological functions—and, in many cases, pathological functions—are influenced either directly or indirectly by sex-based differences in biology.” Because genetics and physiology are among the influences on an individual’s health, the “incidence and severity of diseases vary between the sexes.” Far from its being discrimination to “rely on a patient’s sex,” it is a requirement of good medicine, which is sex-specific to the male or female body of the patient. But that’s not all. Suppose the argument is that the doctor/hospital/insurer covers double mastectomies in the case of cancer, but not in the case of gender dysphoria. For a discrimination claim to be successful, you’d have to argue that a patient with cancerous breast tissue is comparable, similarly situated to a patient with healthy breast tissue. Perhaps some physicians will argue that the non-cancerous breasts are in fact unhealthy because they are the cause of the gender dysphoria. That will only further highlight that what we really have here is a disagreement about the diagnosis and treatment of gender dysphoria. And policies—like the Trump administration’s recent regulation on Section 1557 of the ACA—are entirely defensible for refusing to treat a disagreement on medical care as if it were discrimination based on identity. Something similar is true for the Trump policies on Title IX and school sports. For an argument about discrimination to succeed, you’d have to say that an athlete with male muscle mass, bone structure, and lung capacity (to take just a few specifics) is comparable, similarly situated to an athlete with female muscle mass, bone structure, and lung capacity. If you can recognize that these are not in fact comparable, similarly situated individuals, then it’s hard to make a claim that “discrimination” in the pejorative sense has occurred. Yes, we’ve treated males and females differently—we have an NBA and a WNBA—but that is precisely in order to treat them equally. Equality—fairness—in athletic competition frequently requires taking the bodily differences between males and females seriously. By comparison, it never requires taking skin color into account. Thankfully, the days of racially segregated sports are over. Our skin color makes no difference to what we do on the athletic field. Nor does it make a difference in the bathroom, locker room, or shelter. That’s why bans on racial discrimination did away with separate facilities for black and white. But bans on sex discrimination did not do away with separate facilities for male and female—a reality that Gorsuch’s simplistic test for discrimination fails to account for. The reason? A person with male genitalia is not comparable, not similarly situated to a person with female genitalia when it comes to an emergency shelter or locker room. As a result, this aspect of the Trump administration’s recent HUD rule on sex-based housing is eminently defensible. All of these administrative actions, of course, can be readily undone by a future hostile administration. Just look at what Joe Biden has already promised. Thus, we’ll need litigation and legislation not solely on religious liberty, but on the substantive issues at stake: privacy and safety in single-sex facilities, equality and fairness in single-sex sports, and good medicine based on the realities of our biological make up as male or female human beings. Through litigation and legislation, we need to make it clear that it’s lawful to act on the convictions that we are created male and female, and that male and female are created for each other, that no institution has to let males compete against females in sports, that no institution has to allow males into women-only locker-rooms and shelters, that no physician has to engage in so-called “gender-affirming” care. The religious liberty triumphs of the past several days are important. But they’re not enough. Not nearly so."},

Pitting men and women against each other with simplistic statistics about a gender wage gap needlessly adds to the real pain. Tuesday, March 31, is a fairly random day selected as “Equal Pay Day” by the National Committee on Pay Equity to draw attention to the difference in the median annual earnings of all men and women working full time for wages or a salary. According to the committee, the date “symbolizes how far into the year women must work to earn what men earned in the previous year.” To the extent that implies that women get paid less than men for doing the same work, that representation is just plain wrong. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2018, women who were full-time wage and salary workers had median weekly earnings of 81% compared with men. That’s a simple statistic that does not allow us to draw any conclusions beyond stating that if you take all men and women working full time in the economy, and take the person in the middle of each distribution, the woman in the middle earns 81% of what the man in the middle earns. It provides no answers to the question of whether men and women receive equal pay for equal work. To answer that question, we need to dig deeper and consider a number of factors that determine pay, including the number of hours worked, occupations and industries, education, experience, and tenure, and the distribution of benefits-to-cash compensation. Once we account for relevant factors for which we have available and reliable data, the wage gap all but disappears. To the extent that we observe differences between men and women in the workplace, many of those differences come down to the different preferences and choices individuals make—with the starkest differences observed for working mothers, compared with both working men (fathers included) and women. Some of those differences include: And yet, we observe differences in compensation even when men and women work in the same job and under completely identical compensation structures. A study examining the earnings of male and female bus and train operators for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority identified that women earned 89% of what men earned, concluding that “while having the same choice sets in the workplace, women and men make different choices.” As my heritage Foundation colleague Rachel Greszler elaborated: Women and men have different earnings in large part because of the choices they make about how much to work, in which jobs and industries to work, and which aspects of a job are important to them. Some of those choices are likely influenced by social and cultural factors and the opportunities we encounter, based on the environments in which we are born and raised. The good news is that in the United States today, men and women are paid based on the contributions they make and the wages and working conditions they are able to negotiate, rather than based on their sex. As the nation confronts the novel coronavirus threat, we should remember that we are all in this together. Both men and women are best served by a strong economy that provides them with opportunities to work and provide for their families, in accordance with their own values and abilities. The economic disruptions experienced by millions of workers due to necessary measures to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus know no sex."},

"], "text": "Radical gender ideology—the belief that whether one is male or female is rooted in subjective feeling, not objective fact—has gained devoted adherents in the most influential spheres of our culture. The argument that one’s chosen gender should override biological sex has taken hold even when it comes to medical care. The coronavirus pandemic, however, has again highlighted the importance of basing medicine on scientific facts. Though much is still unknown about the virus and its effects, there is strong evidence that it affects men and women differently. Early statistics from Italy, where the outbreak has been severe, indicated that many more men than women have died from the disease, with men constituting more than 70% of COVID-19 deaths. As scientists and medical professionals race to find effective treatments for the virus and provide the best possible care, they need clear data, including accurate records of basic information—such as a patient’s sex. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service, for example, has long since adopted transgender ideology in an attempt to placate activists. But now this choice may be putting its coronavirus patients at greater risk. An online questionnaire intended to help screen patients who think they may have contracted the virus includes a standard request for patients to specify whether they are male or female. Next to this question, however, the website provides a link titled “Why aren’t there more options?” beyond those two categories. Users who follow this link are informed that “Some clinical assessments can be different depending on your sex. Not everyone sees themselves as female or male” and that they should call the NHS hotline “if neither option is right for you.” Unfortunately, this isn’t an isolated incident of ideological activism gaining a foothold within the medical community. On March 13, just as authorities in the U.K. and the United States were announcing drastic new measures to slow the spread of the virus, the NHS website published a blog post titled “Ensuring pregnant trans men get equal quality care,” demonstrating just how deeply embedded transgender ideology has become in Britain’s state-run healthcare system. Science has consistently recognized sex as an objective physical trait determined by an organism’s overall organization with respect to reproduction. Humans, like other mammals, are a sexually dimorphic species, with recognizable characteristics distinguishing males and females. Every cell in the body carries chromosomes that indicate a person’s sex and direct physical development. This reality has well-recognized implications for medical care. Men and women have notably different rates of illness, heart disease, and diabetes, and they differ in their responses to medication, which is critical knowledge when treating a patient. Subjective gender identity or social presentation is no substitute for biological reality when it comes to medicine. As the NHS’s questionnaire indicates, sex distinctions do matter when treating COVID-19. The preference for politics and ideology over science has led to confused messaging from activists. A coalition of more than 100 prominent activist groups recently released a joint letter claiming that gay and transgender people are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus due to higher rates of smoking, a higher population of immunosuppressed individuals due to the treatment of HIV and cancer, and invidious discrimination in the medical system. The city government of San Francisco’s official website provides similar information and advises residents who identify as transgender to be aware of their heightened risk. If people who identify as LGBT are in particular danger from the virus, then we must be unified in working to ensure that they get the best medical care possible. However, continuing denial of the relevance of biological sex to treatment creates a needless complication in ensuring everyone receives lifesaving medical care. Substituting self-determined gender identity for the scientific fact of biological sex dangerously gambles with human life. At some point, activists will have to choose one or the other: concede to biological reality or maintain their ideology at all costs—which would mean endangering the lives and health of the very population for which they advocate. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, the vital importance of keeping politicized ideology out of medicine is becoming clearer by the day."},

Some of them have recently gotten into Monopoly, the classic board game. But my kids won’t be playing Hasbro’s new version, Ms. Monopoly, which gives women 20% more than men when they pass go. As an economist, I love classic Monopoly and its real-world financial lessons. As a person, I like the message conveyed by the new Ms. Monopoly cover — that young, hip women can be as successful, if not more, than old white men in stuffy suits and top hats. The problem is what's inside the box. Ms. Monopoly's unequal rules not only distort real-world realities; they would surely incite conflict between my boys and girls. Don’t get me wrong. I’m a woman. I have three sisters. I have three daughters. I fully embrace the contributions women make to society and their families, and I celebrate the substantial gains and accomplishments women have made in education, earnings and career advancements over the last half-century. But I do not see how a game that gives women a head start supports or encourages either women or men. Instead, it just embeds inequity and incites resentment. If my children played this game, I’m sure my girls would be thrilled — at first — over the advantages it offers. No doubt they’d gloat as they passed go and pocketed 20% more than their brothers. And I’m equally sure these things would upset my boys, leading them to retaliate with verbal jabs at their sisters. If one of the girls won, the boys would give her no credit, claiming it was only because the rules of the game were unfair. And if one of the boys won. Wow. I can hear the disparagements now, about how girls must be really lame if they can’t win even with a huge advantage. Either way, the girls wouldn't come out feeling good about themselves, and the boys would be either angry and resentful or prideful. The same thing happens when organizations and politicians tell women they get paid less than men for performing the exact same job and attempt to legislate equal paychecks across genders. It is true that across the U.S., the average woman makes about 80% as much as the average man. But it's also true that the average woman works significantly fewer hours, chooses a lower-paying occupation, and values benefits and flexibility more than the average man. After accounting for all the measurable factors that employers take into account when determining pay, studies find the apparent “pay gap” is actually much smaller: between 5 and 7 cents according to a 2009 Department of Labor study; a mere 2009 Department of Labor study; a mere 2 cents according to a 2018 payscale.com study. Harder-to-measure factors such as differences in workplace flexibility and benefits likely account for some of the remaining gap. Women tend to value flexibility more than men do, but that quality-of-life advantage would be the first to go if Congress attempts to close the so-called gender pay gap through legislation such as the Paycheck Fairness Act. Far from helping women, such attempts to force wage equality bring about rigid pay scales, rigid work rules, lower wages, lower productivity and hiring discrimination. Women already have both the law and free markets on their side. Equal pay for equal work has been the law of the land for more than five decades, and the free market penalizes employers who discriminate against women by putting them at a disadvantage against competitors who don't discriminate. Women don't need politicians to paint them as victims and then step in and save the day. They can stand on their own accomplishments when it comes to being paid for what they produce. And they don't need special-edition games intended to “empower” women by applying discriminatory rules that suggest women cannot win without special treatment and undue advantage. That's not a message I want my girls or boys to embrace. Instead, I want them to believe that they are equally capable of achieving what they set their minds to. And I want the paychecks they receive to reflect the choices they make, the effort they put forth, and the results they achieve as opposed to the value that some government official or stacked game deck assigns to them."},

Male athletes Cece (formerly Craig) Telfer and June (formerly Jonathan) Eastwood both have been competing in NCAA women’s sports for the past year. Both previously competed on their school’s men’s teams and were competitive in the men’s division. Both have taken medication to suppress testosterone according to the NCAA guidelines, but unlike in Olympic guidelines, there is no maximum level of testosterone that transgender athletes must not exceed in NCAA sports. That means that many transgender athletes are still competing in women’s sports with significantly higher levels of testosterone than that of biological women. Furthermore, there are other bodily features characteristic of males that won’t disappear with hormone suppressors, such as bone density and height. Some argue that Telfer and Eastwood do not have an unfair advantage because they did not win every women’s meet in which they competed. Yet, their records show that their presence had a significant detrimental impact on the biological women against whom they competed. Telfer decided to join the women’s track and field team at Franklin Pierce University in New Hampshire as a fifth-year senior, pursuing a second major. Telfer had previously left the sport after three years on the men’s team. On the women’s team, Telfer has had a number of victories. He won the NCAA Division II title in the women’s 400-meter hurdles and was celebrated as the first transgender woman to do so. Telfer also finished fifth in the 100-meter at the same meet. Despite some losses, Telfer has made a name in the sport, winning titles at the Northeast-10 Championships in the 60-meter, 200-meter, and 60-meter hurdles and received the Most Outstanding Athlete honors. Telfer has also been a key factor in the Franklin Pierce women’s track and field team’s first ranking in the top 25 nationally. Eastwood is another transgender athlete who has taken up track and field on a women’s team in the past year. In high school, Jonathan Eastwood held state titles in the 800-meter, 1,600-meter, and 3,200-meter races, as well as in cross-country. In college, he competed on the University of Montana men’s cross-country team for the first three years. While on the men’s team, his times were significantly faster than the women’s collegiate records in the 800-meter, 1,500-meter, and 5,000-meter races. Taking testosterone-suppression medication has slowed down the now-June Eastwood, yet he remains a competitive threat to women. In Eastwood’s first meet on the women’s team, he finished seventh overall and second on Montana’s team. Even though Eastwood didn’t dominate, running that race enabled the Montana women’s team to finish second in the meet instead of third. Since then, Eastwood has continued to outpace biological women. For instance, the runner was named Big Sky Athlete of the Week after placing second at the Bronco Invitational. Eastwood also placed eighth at the Big Sky Conference Cross-Country Championships in Colorado. In fact, Eastwood and another teammate were in the top 10, earning honors and making it the first time in nine years that Montana has had two top 10 finishers. Both Telfer and Eastwood are examples of a growing trend of biological males taking over female sports.  With the rise of transgender policies in sports that allow biological men and boys to compete against women and girls, the playing field will be irreversibly skewed toward the biologically male athletes. Women and girls will lose their competitiveness. While it does not appear that either of these two athletes began to compete with the opposite sex out of spite or ambition, the results nonetheless remain the same: Females lose anytime a biological male competes as a female. No matter how many hormones a biological male takes, every time he competes against a female, he has an unfair advantage. It’s a denial of science and shows complete disregard for fairness to say that a male athlete who identifies as female is just the same as the biological females there. A place on the roster, team, or podium did not spontaneously open up for him. Instead, some girl or woman didn’t make the team, fell lower in the rankings, or didn’t do as well because of an unfairly tilted playing field.

That’s the question the Supreme Court will consider Tuesday when it hears arguments in Harris Funeral Homes v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The Supremes’ answer could have enormous implications for women’s rights. Harris Funeral Homes has helped families in Detroit navigate the grieving process for more than a century. To be as unobtrusive as possible, the directors at this family-owned business follow a basic dress code: Men wear dark business suits; women wear skirt suits. The dress code complies with federal law. For six years, Anthony Stephens followed it. Then he ­announced that he would take a two-week vacation and returned to work dressed as a woman ­going by the name Aimee. The owners faced a dilemma: They cared about Stephens; they also cared about the grieving families they served. They had concerns about how Stephens’ dressing as a woman would affect clients’ grieving. Also problematic were the funeral home’s single-sex bathrooms: Should they make female ­employees and guests share a bathroom with Stephens? Ultimately they decided to let Stephens go. Then they got sued for sex discrimination. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission during the Obama years sided with Stephens. President Trump’s Department of Justice has supported the funeral home. Team Trump has the better legal argument. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 bans employment discrimination because of sex. That means no double standards for men and women: You can’t have a funeral home that hires only men as ­funeral directors and women as morticians; you can’t have an ­accounting firm that promotes aggressive men for being manly but punishes aggressive women for being “unladylike.” While the Civil Rights Act bans these double standards, it requires “neither asexuality nor androgyny,” as a unanimous high court ruled in a 1998 case. That’s why bans on sex discrimination didn’t abolish sex-specific private facilities (like bathrooms), sex-specific fitness standards (for police and firefighters) or sex-specific athletic competitions (like the NBA and WNBA). After all, sex-specific bathrooms, fitness standards and sports leagues don’t disfavor men or women. On the contrary, they prevent disadvantageous treatment. Forcing women to undress in locker rooms with men or to compete athletically against competitors with male muscle mass and stamina wouldn’t respect equality but undermine it. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took this point for granted when she wrote the high court’s majority opinion instructing the all-male Virginia Military Institute to become co-ed. She noted that going co-ed “would undoubtedly require alterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in living arrangements.” Excluding women from VMI, Ginsburg argued, discriminated on the basis of sex. Keeping men out of women’s private facilities, however, didn’t. This shouldn’t be controversial. The Obama administration ­attempted to turn all of this upside down by claiming the word “sex” in our civil rights laws was determined by someone’s subjective “gender identity.” It’s an odd legal argument, given that the public meaning of the word “sex” — in 1964 and still today — refers to objective biological reality, not subjective identity. Liberal activists have tried for years to get Congress to add “gender identity” as a protected class. Having failed, they took their arguments to unaccountable bureaucrats and activist judges. They failed with the bureaucrats, until Team Obama came around. And they failed in the courts — until March 2018, when a federal circuit court held that the Civil Rights Act banned discrimination based on transgender status. Activists want the Supreme Court to affirm this novel ruling. To do so, the court would have to rewrite the law, thus usurping Congress’ role. People who identify as transgender should be treated with dignity and respect. Whenever possible, we should make them feel comfortable. But the price of that accommodation can’t be the erasure of girls and women. It can’t be a law that requires businesses to allow males into female-only spaces — or that requires schools to allow boys who identify as girls into the girls’ locker room or onto their athletic teams. Thankfully, the Civil Rights Act doesn’t require any of this. The Supreme Court shouldn’t rewrite our nation’s civil-rights laws in a way that would directly undermine one of their main purposes: protecting the equal rights of girls and women.

"], "text": "This week, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in cases that ask whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bans employment discrimination on the basis of sex, extends to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and transgender status. It’s an odd legal argument, given that the public meaning of the word “sex” in 1964—and today, for that matter—refers to our status as male or female, not our sexual attractions, desires, actions, or identity. That’s why progressive activists have been trying for the past forty years to get Congress to pass laws that would add “sexual orientation” as a protected class, and it’s why they’ve been doing the same for “gender identity” for the past dozen years. Because their attempts to work through the legislative process failed, activists took their arguments to court. And they failed there, too—at least, until April 2017. That marked the first time ever that a federal appellate court ruled that the Civil Rights Act prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Prior to that ruling, all 11 appellate courts that had addressed the issue had ruled that “sex” does not mean “sexual orientation.” And it wasn’t until March 2018 that, for the first time ever, an appellate court ruled that Title VII banned discrimination based on transgender status. Activists would like to see the Supreme Court affirm these novel—indeed, activist—appellate court rulings, redefining the term “sex” in the Civil Rights Act and embracing a simplistic account of “discrimination.” Here’s why it shouldn’t. What Is Sex Discrimination? In 1998, the Supreme Court explained in Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., that Title VII requires “neither asexuality nor androgyny.” It requires equality and neutrality. It does not exclude all sex-conscious standards, but it does exclude double standards for men and women—policies that disfavor at least some individuals of one sex compared to similarly situated members of the other. That was the explicit position of the unanimous court in Oncale, which quoted Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg: “The critical issue, Title VII’s text indicates, is whether members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.” The unanimous court in Oncale echoed what a plurality opinion had said several years earlier, in the 1989 case Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins: that sex may not be used to create “disparate treatment of men and women.” Under Oncale and Price Waterhouse, courts applying Title VII must ask whether some women are subject to disadvantageous terms not faced by men in a similar position, or vice versa. Courts must look, in short, for unfairness due to sex. Mere consideration of sex is not enough. This is why bans on sex discrimination didn’t abolish sex-specific private facilities (like bathrooms), sex-specific fitness standards (for police and firefighters, for example), or sex-specific athletic competitions (like the NBA and WNBA). After all, sex-specific bathrooms, fitness standards, and sports leagues don’t create disadvantageous conditions. On the contrary, they prevent disadvantageous treatment. That’s because they take sex differences seriously where they make a difference, for the sake of privacy and equality. Yet LGBT activists effectively urge the court to adopt a theory of sex discrimination that would rule out any policies that refer to sex, judging them to be inherently discriminatory. That would lead to asexuality and androgyny—precisely what the court has said Title VII does not require. Title VII Does Not Simply Forbid Any Action ‘Causally Linked’ to Sex The oral arguments this week center on whether the ban on “sex” discrimination extends to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and transgender status. The only way for the lawyers arguing this position to make their case is to reject the Ginsburg reading of Title VII—where it prohibits double standards for men and women—and to advance a novel theory where any reference to sex constitutes discrimination on the basis of sex. While this new approach is increasingly hailed as providing a knockdown textualist argument, it suffers from a fatal flaw. According to the version proposed by lawyers for the employee in the gender identity case (Stephens), “any time the same decision would not have been made had the employee’s sex been different, an employer discriminates ‘because of sex.’” In the same vein, law professors Andy Koppelman and Bill Eskridge, amici on the side of the employees, propose that “an employer violates the law if it (1) takes negative employment action (2) that is causally linked to (3) the sex of the employee.” This theory fails, because not every employment policy “causally linked” to sex imposes a disadvantage on individuals of one sex compared to similarly situated members of the other sex. So the theory doesn’t isolate sex discrimination. It flouts the Ginsburg reading—on which Title VII forbids only double standards for the sexes. Contrary to Oncale, it requires asexuality and androgyny. To see why, let’s look at what embracing this theory would require. Suppose a male employee at a fitness center repeatedly goes into the women’s locker room and is fired. Had his “sex been different” he would not have been fired. In that sense, his termination was “causally linked” to his sex. But the termination was not sex discrimination, because it reflected no double standard for men and women. Female employees who went into the men’s locker room would be fired too. The employer was simply enforcing a locker room policy that imposed the same “burden” on men and women: restriction to one specific locker room, based on sex. Or suppose a female lifeguard is fired because she wears swimsuit bottoms but refuses to wear tops. Had her “sex been different,” she would not have been fired. The decision to fire her was “causally linked” to her sex. Yet her termination was not sex discrimination under Title VII, because a male lifeguard who exposed his private parts would have similarly been fired. The attire policy did not create a disadvantage for women that it did not impose on men: Both are required to dress in ways that cover private parts. The test put forth by the LGBT advocates is too simplistic. It does not test for sex-based discrimination. In both of the above examples, the employees were fired because they violated policies that do not disadvantage women compared to analogous men, or vice versa. Far from being an instance of sex discrimination, preventing males from entering women-only private facilities is actually required to avoid sex discrimination. Ginsburg took this point for granted in her majority opinion in United States v. Virginia, when she explained that, for the all-male Virginia Military Institute to become co-ed, it “would undoubtedly require alterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in living arrangements.” Moreover, in 1975, when critics argued that the Equal Rights Amendment would require unisex intimate facilities, then-professor Ginsburg explained that a ban on sex discrimination would not require such an outcome: “Separate places to disrobe, sleep, perform personal bodily functions are permitted, in some situations required, by regard for individual privacy.” So it isn’t sex discrimination to act in a way “causally linked” to sex when sex is a relevant factor and you don’t disadvantage individuals of one sex compared to similarly situated members of the other sex. By contrast, an employer who allowed males to enter private women-only facilities would be guilty of sex discrimination under Title VII, because doing so would foster a hostile work environment. Yet the activists would hold such an employer guilty if he prevented males from entering. Their theory requires asexuality and androgyny, but Title VII does not—it forbids double standards and protects sensible workplace privacy policies. Double Standards Based on Sex Are at the Heart of Sex Discrimination The simplistic account of discrimination is easy to see when you look at concrete examples. Lawyers for Stephens, the employee in the gender identity case, claim: But this assertion ignores the actual structure of the discrimination in Phillips. Phillips was discriminated against on the basis of sex because men with young children were not held to the same terms as women with young children. Had both men and women been held to the same standard, there would have been no disparate impact on men and women and hence no double standard. Nor is there any double standard here. Both males and females who refused to abide by the dress code would be treated in the same way. The same is true in the sexual orientation cases. Yet lawyers for one of the employees there (Zarda) argue: But the reason Martin Marietta was guilty of discrimination based on sex was not that it used certain magical words (“women with young children,” rather than “mothers”), but that it went easier on “men with young children” and “fathers.” If it had had an evenhanded policy regarding all “people with young children” and “parents,” there would have been no sex discrimination. So, too, an evenhanded policy against same-sex relationships does not discriminate on the basis of sex. The lawyers obscure this dispositive point by picking the wrong comparator. Comparing Zarda to “persons who shared his attraction to men but not his sex (i.e., ‘heterosexual women’)” changes two factors—sex and sexual orientation—and so fails to ferret out the basis for the employment decision. Comparing a homosexual man to a heterosexual woman will not tell us whether the employment decision was driven by sex or by sexual orientation. In determining the basis of an employment decision, we should hold orientation constant and vary just the employee’s sex: the question is whether men and women attracted to their own sex are treated differently from each other. Stephens’ argument, too, changes two factors—sex and transgender status. Stephens argues that Harris Homes “would not have fired Ms. Stephens for identifying and living openly as a woman if she were assigned a female sex at birth.” Well, yes, Harris Homes would not fire a woman who followed the women’s dress code. But that’s not an apt comparison to Stephens—a man who sought to follow the women’s dress code. Comparing Stephens to a cisgender woman changes two factors—sex and transgender status—and thus fails to hold constant all factors but sex. The proper comparison would be a woman who sought to dress according to the men’s dress code. That way both employees identify as transgender, and all that is changed is their sex. Comparing a transgender male to a cisgender female will not tell us whether the employment decision was driven by sex or by transgender status. The question is whether men and women who identify as the opposite sex are treated differently from each other. Harris Homes reports it would dismiss a female employee who sought to abide by the male dress code. In other words, there’s no double standard for men and women, so there’s no discrimination on the basis of sex. Both males and females who identify as transgender are held to the same standard. 3 Different Forms of Discrimination Imagine an employer who won’t employ women but will employ men, or who won’t employ women with kids but will employ men with kids. This would be discrimination on the basis of sex, because “members of one sex are exposed to disadvantageous terms or conditions of employment to which members of the other sex are not exposed.” It’s a double standard for men and women. By contrast, consider an employer who will hire straight men and women, but not men and women who identify as gay. Men and women are exposed to the same exact terms and conditions, so this wouldn’t be discrimination based on sex. The employment action doesn’t hinge on male or female, but on gay or straight. And lastly, consider an employer who will hire cisgender men and women, but not transgender men and women. Here, too, men and women are exposed to the same exact terms and conditions, so this wouldn’t be discrimination based on sex. The employment action here isn’t concerned fundamentally with male or female, but with cisgender or transgender. Now, whatever you may think about these three cases as a matter of ethics or public policy, Congress acted in 1964 to address only the first case—and it has explicitly rejected policies to address the latter two. People can debate whether that is or is not a good thing. But, as a legal matter, the issue is clear. Discrimination on the basis of sex is prohibited, but discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity is not. And, of course, there’s good reason why Congress has rejected calls to legally prohibit “discrimination” on the basis of “sexual orientation and gender identity.” Much of what the activists claim is “discrimination” is simply disagreement about human sexuality, where acting based on true beliefs about human sexuality is re-described as discriminatory. Redefining Sex and Embracing a Simplistic Account of Discrimination Will Have Drastic Consequences If the Supreme Court were to adopt the activists’ theory, it would not simply distort the statutory text but would also cause serious practical harms—and unsurprisingly so. After all, the court would be rewriting the law Congress passed—but with no opportunity for legislators to add to the definitions, qualifications, and limits they might have included if they had actually decided to address sexual orientation and gender identity. For instance, the activists’ position would either require the elimination of all sex-specific programs and facilities or allow access based on an individual’s subjective identity rather than his or her objective biology. It is telling that the activists are evasive about which of these outcomes is required by their theory. Making the theory’s implications explicit would prove decisively that their reading is unsound. It would also highlight the severe consequences for privacy, safety, and equality. Employers would be prevented from protecting their employees’ privacy and would be exposed to ruinous liability. They would have to cover objectionable medical treatments. Physicians would have to perform them against conscience. And the consequences would not be limited to the employment context. If this new theory of sex and of discrimination is imposed on Title VII, then why not Title IX? Yet an activist reading of sex discrimination would spell the end of girls’ and women’s athletics, and of private facilities at school. In short, activists ask the court to rewrite our nation’s civil rights laws in a way that would directly undermine one of their main purposes: protecting the equal rights of girls and women. Congress did not legislate such an outcome, and the court should not usurp Congress’ authority by imposing such an extreme policy on the nation. Biology is not bigotry, and the court should not conclude otherwise. Only Congress, not the court, can craft policy to address sexual orientation and gender identity—distinct concepts from sex—with attention to all the competing considerations."},

At issue is the meaning of the word “sex” in Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the primary federal law prohibiting discrimination in employment. The cases were brought by a gay child welfare services coordinator and a gay skydiving instructor in the first argument, and, in the second argument, a male funeral home director who was fired after announcing he was transitioning to become a woman. A packed house was promised outside the Supreme Court building, where people began lining up Friday for public seating. And inside the courtroom was just as busy, with five lawyers appearing before the justices. Pamela Karlan, a professor at Stanford Law School, argued on behalf of the gay employees in Bostock v. Clayton County and Altitude Express v. Zarda. Jeffrey Harris, a lawyer with the firm Consovoy McCarthy, made his Supreme Court debut representing the employers in Bostock and Zarda. David Cole of the American Civil Liberties Union represented the transgender employee, while John Bursch of Alliance Defending Freedom argued for the person’s employer in Harris Funeral Homes v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco shared time with the employers in both arguments. Following a new rule announced last week by the high court, the justices allowed each advocate to make a two-minute presentation before jumping in with questions. Some common themes from the justices’ questions were what “sex” meant in 1964, whether the court should act when Congress could amend the law, and what this could mean for single-sex bathrooms, sports, and more. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the first to fire off a question. She brought up the fact that when Congress passed Title VII as part of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, it couldn’t have been in Congress’ mind that discrimination “because of sex” meant discrimination based on sexual orientation. Ginsburg underscored this point by noting that homosexuality was at that time classified as a mental disorder, and many states criminalized sodomy. >>>Listen to “SCOTUS 101,” a podcast with Elizabeth Slattery and friends bringing you up to speed on what’s happening at the Supreme Court. Karlan admitted that is true—calling it the “days of ‘Mad Men,’” in a reference to the hit TV series—but said the court has interpreted Title VII to cover other things that weren’t within Congress’ mind, such as sexual harassment and sex stereotyping. When Harris took the lectern, he explained that sex and sexual orientation are “independent and distinct characteristics,” and that Title VII requires courts to compare similarly situated people for differential treatment. Francisco echoed this, saying that sex means “whether you’re male or female, not whether you’re gay or straight.” He argued that any doubt regarding the meaning of sex in Title VII “is removed by the history … and related statutes since.” Justice Samuel Alito noted that Congress has considered various proposals to amend Title VII and, in fact, the House of Representatives passed the Equality Act last spring. He asked whether the courts should leave this policy issue to the legislative branch. Karlan countered that a ruling that sex discrimination includes sexual orientation would be no different from the court’s earlier rulings finding male-on-male sexual harassment and sex stereotyping were forms of sex discrimination. Chief Justice John Roberts pointed out that roughly two dozen states have passed laws prohibiting employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and many have at the same time provided robust protections for religious liberty. Harris picked up on this point, noting that Wisconsin was hailed as a civil rights pioneer when it passed a law banning sexual orientation discrimination in employment in 1982. Such laws would not have been necessary, he said, if Title VII’s ban on sex discrimination already included sexual orientation and gender identity. Francisco also addressed this point, saying that Congress is better suited to weigh the competing interests at stake and address the need for religious or other exemptions. He suggested the Supreme Court should not short-circuit the democratic process and instead allow Congress to work out what changes, if any, the American people want to see in Title VII. The justices spent a lot of time talking about whether employees’ interpretation of Title VII would spell doom for single-sex bathrooms, sex-specific dress codes, single-sex college sports teams, and shelters for battered women. Title VII, after all, is a statute promoting women’s equality, Bursch pointed out, and it allows employers to acknowledge that there are differences between men and women. But the ACLU’s Cole tried to avoid answering these questions, eventually responding that one has to consider “not just whether [a single-sex or sex-specific policy] differentiates, but whether it differentiates in a way that injures,” and whether a reasonable person would experience “a significant or trivial harm.” “Most instances, that’s not going to be a significant harm,” Cole said, but when, for example, “you ask a transgender person to dress in a way that is contrary to their sense of gender identity, you have imposed a significant harm.” Karlan put it slightly differently, explaining that you first look for people being treated differently based on their sex, and then you ask if a reasonable person would be injured by that differential treatment. Justice Neil Gorsuch wanted to know how one decides what is “reasonable.” Karlan replied that an “idiosyncratic preference” wouldn’t void a dress code or bathroom policy. Anyone hoping for clarity after the day’s argument was left wanting. After two hours of oral argument and dozens of questions, there was not much agreement among the justices. Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor suggested several times that they think the text clearly favors the employees’ view. Alito and Roberts mentioned concerns about the court’s overstepping its boundaries. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the high court’s newest justice, barely spoke at all. The justices will take the next several months to wrestle with the questions in these cases and likely issue rulings by the end of June."},

Sex differences determine performance."], "text": "I began playing golf in junior high. But I didn't meet another female golfer until I was in Division I Intercollegiate golf in the early 1990s. Blessed with a father who wasn't embarrassed to take his daughter out on the course, I was introduced to the sport when most players were men. Though more than 20 years had passed since Congress passed Title IX, women were still nearly invisible on golf courses when I was growing up. Title IX required schools to establish separate women's sports teams to receive federal funding. That increased funding led to an explosion in female participation, from 1 in 27 girls before Title IX to 2 in 5 girls now, a 900 percent increase. The benefits should be obvious. Not only do girls who play sports stay in school longer and suffer fewer health problems, research shows that 94 percent of female C-Suite executives played sports. But Congress will vote this week on the Equality Act, which in the words of Duke Professor Doriane Lambelet Coleman \"will be the end of girl's and women's only sports.\" Why? Because the Equality Act would redefine sex in the 1964 Civil Rights Act, basing it not on biology, but on self-perceived gender identity. Female athletes nationwide are already losing to males who argue that sex-segregated sports is unfair discrimination. But athletes who identify as the opposite sex aren't excluded from competing against their physical equals. Instead, they are seeking to compete in categories created to provide an equal playing field for all athletes. In 1967, organizers of the Boston Marathon believed women were incapable of running 26 miles, until a woman proved them wrong by fighting off race security to cross the finish line. Last year, 11,639 women completed the race. But when the world-record holder Paula Radcliffe learned about the Boston marathon's new transgender policy, she objected. Opening women's qualifying times up to any male who \"self-identifies\" as female is unfair, she noted, because the end result will be that female qualifying times are made harder due to the added numbers achieving them.\" The Equality Act isn't about including those who were unfairly excluded from sports. It's about meeting the demands of a powerful political group for unfair advantage. This politicizes sports, and there is no clear limit to where that will end. If one athlete can identify as the opposite sex, then why can't another identify as a different age? The unfairness of allowing someone born with male physiology to compete against women should be as obvious as that of allowing adults to compete against children. Fairness requires that rules be based on physical realities. The Civil Rights Act addressed the illegitimate exclusion from educational opportunities on the basis of an immutable characteristic race. But in sports, sex and age are two legitimate categories upon which rules should be based. Sex differences determine performance. The ceiling for women's testosterone levels (2.4 nanomoles per liter (npl)) does not even reach the floor for men's testosterone levels (10 npl). Some transgender athletes say female athletes should just try harder, but no amount of trying harder will overcome the huge advantage of testosterone. We should treat people suffering gender dysphoria with compassion and respect. But that doesn't mean legislators should pass laws that put female athletes at such a disadvantage. Even some in the LGBT community, such as tennis great Martina Navratilova, recognize something bigger is at stake. It comes down to a choice between politics and sports. Supporters of the Equality Act should listen to the female high school runners in Connecticut who describe losing to transgender athletes as \"heartbreaking.\" Will Congress turn the clock back by denying these girls the opportunity to compete against their own sex? Or can we keep politics out of sports so both men and women can play to win?"},
{"title": "Newly Proposed Transgender Policies Could Harm Elderly and the Young", "author": ["Emilie  Kao", "Nicholas  Marr"], "date": "Jul 2, 2019 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/newly-proposed-transgender-policies-could-harm-elderly-and-the-young", "takeaways": [], "text": "Congress is right when it considers policies that serve the most vulnerable Americans, particularly children and the elderly, who are most susceptible to abuse. But such policies come under threat when controversial gender ideology is injected into the language of otherwise good legislation. That’s what is happening with two bills under consideration: the Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act and the Older Americans Act. The sexual orientation and gender identity language in these bills threatens to elevate the political priorities of some at the cost of the safety, privacy, and liberty of many. It could obstruct the work of service providers in these fields as it already has in the areas of homelessness and foster care. Moreover, such language could drive a wedge between parents and their children. Dangers of Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Language Recent debates in the House over the Equality Act highlighted some of the perils of adding the language of gender identity and sexual orientation into federal law. Because of state laws that enshrine this language, medical providers are being sued because they do not support transgender activists’ recommended medical treatments for gender dysphoria. These include the experimental use of hormones on children as young as 8 and double mastectomies on girls as young as 13. There is vigorous debate in the medical community about the best treatments for gender dysphoria. Some distinguished professionals do not think transition surgery is good medicine. Yet in 15 states, transgender activists have already succeeded in banning counseling that would allow parents and children to undergo a period of “watchful waiting” to see if children become comfortable with their bodies. This is unwise. Individuals who suffer from anorexia, bulimia, body integrity identity disorder (the desire for loss of a limb or a sense), or gender dysphoria experience deep discomfort with their bodies, which can lead to mistaken beliefs about themselves and reality. But, as Ryan T. Anderson has explained: Studies show that 80% to 95% of gender-dysphoric children eventually grow out of their dysphoria and become comfortable with their bodies after puberty if there is no hormonal or surgical intervention. Moreover, those who undergo sex-reassignment surgery commit suicide at 19 times the rate of the general population, and almost double the rate of transgender-identifying adults overall. This high rate is not simply owing to a failure of society to accept transgenderism. Adults like Walt Heyer who suffered from gender dysphoria, and now regret having pursued sex-reassignment, say counseling saved them from suicide. James Shupe, who attributes his gender dysphoria to PTSD and other traumas, said the transgender community’s medical recommendations endangered his life. “It did not help me at all,” Shupe said. “It destabilized my mental health, because I was living in a false reality. I was fighting my body. I was fighting society. I perfectly understand why this kills people and why there’s such a high suicide rate. Society gets the blame. It’s not society. It’s the program itself that’s killing us.” This “program” recently led a government agency in Cincinnati to charge parents of a gender-dysphoric girl with child abuse when they expressed a preference for counseling and would not consent to testosterone treatments for their daughter. After the agency’s charge against the parents, a state judge terminated the couple’s parental rights. Similarly, in Illinois, the state has mandated that its child welfare employees and prospective foster parents follow the recommendations of the transgender movement or else be disqualified from serving. A prospective foster parent who wants to allow a gender-dysphoric child a period of “watchful waiting” will be weeded out of the prospective pool of families. This move is especially misguided at a time when there are 17,920 children on the waiting list for foster families in Illinois (and more than 437,500 children nationwide). Putting Transgender Ideology Into Law The House version of the Stronger Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, or H.R. 2480, which passed in May, would expand abuse-prevention outreach requirements to include “sexual and gender minority youth.” The bill itself does not define the term, but references the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s definition of “sexual minority youth” that also includes the term “transgender.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s use of the terminology of transgender theory adopts one side of the debate over the best medical treatments for gender dysphoria. In addition to incorporating the terminology of the transgender movement, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention cites one of the most powerful transgender lobbying organizations, the National Center for Transgender Equality, as a resource. It openly promotes sex-reassignment procedures and supports litigation against those who hold a different view. The National Center for Transgender Equality website states: This isn’t dangerous for the activists, but rather, for people who suffer from gender dysphoria, including youth. And new language in the legislation requires state governors who receive federal funds for child abuse prevention to ensure the state will integrate efforts with organizations that partner with “sexual and gender minority youth.” Medical associations, medical professionals, de-transitioners, biological parents, and prospective parents all stand to be harmed if federal law adopts the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention terminology and accepts the transgender community’s recommended medical treatments for gender dysphoria. If the bill passes the Senate with the same language as the House version, the federal government’s treatment of vulnerable children and youth will be increasingly under the control of the transgender movement’s political ideology. But, as Princeton University professor Robert P. George states, “Changing sexes is a metaphysical impossibility because it is a biological impossibility.” Changes to law that require service providers to affirm sex-reassignment as the only valid treatment for gender dysphoria could ultimately reduce the pool of available providers and lead to greater harms to gender-dysphoric children and their parents. Research Being Ignored To strengthen efforts to address child abuse, lawmakers should consider the well-documented and widely-agreed upon evidence on family structure. The House version of the child abuse legislation draws on the most recent National Incidence Study of Child Abuse to make recommendations, including preference under the Adoption Opportunities program for “sexual and gender minority youth.” But the legislation does not address the population that is statistically most at risk—children in unstable families. Indeed, the bill seems to ignore the study’s findings on family structure, including that children living with a single parent and their unmarried partner were sexually abused at a rate nearly 20 times higher than children living with their married biological parents. When lawmakers create conditions for service providers to partner with the government, they should rely on the highest quality and most reliable research, not on controversial political ideology. Hopefully the Senate will give weight to the evidence that the research provides about family structure and incorporate this information into its public-private partnerships. Doing so would go a long way toward empowering service providers, rather than crowding them out if they don’t assent to controversial new gender ideology. Legislation Could Backfire on the Elderly The other community at risk is the elderly. As Congress considers modernizing the Older Americans Act, Sens. Michael Bennet, D-Colo.; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; and Bob Casey, D-Pa.; have introduced the Inclusive Aging Act. This proposal would establish an Office of Inclusivity and Sexual Health within the Administration on Aging, as well as a new grant program to be carried out under that office. The new grant program would follow the troubling trend of making transgender theory into a political litmus test that excludes some service providers, including faith-based ones, from participating in government-run programs, obtaining licensing, or serving communities in need. Organizations that follow a biology-based definition of sex rather than transgender theory may not be able to satisfy new requirements in the Older Americans Act unless they offer the full array of “sexual health services,” or that they have a “formal relationship” with organizations that assist LGBT individuals. The legislation would establish an Office of Inclusivity, and only elder care providers who can prove they embrace LGBT ideology will be eligible for grant money. In California and Murkowski’s home state of Alaska, both faith-based and secular women’s homeless shelters are embroiled in litigation over whether transgender theory will override the sex-segregation of private facilities such as sleeping facilities and showers. Similarly, the introduction of transgender theory into the elder care arena could complicate the work of facilities such as nursing homes that have sex-segregated private facilities. Letting Faith Groups Continue to Serve These are the clear harms that could result if the government conditions efforts to care for the vulnerable on assent to controversial new political views about sexuality and sex differences. Many in this nation are moved to care for the least among us because of their faith. Each year in America, an estimated 350,000 religious congregations operate schools, pregnancy resource centers, soup kitchens, drug addiction programs, homeless shelters, and adoption agencies that serve 70 million Americans. The value of their services is estimated at $44.3 billion annually. Religious organizations account for 40% of the top 50 U.S. charities. But if these organizations and others must accept beliefs about sexuality and sex differences that are opposed to scientific and medical knowledge and to their religious beliefs, they may not be able to continue serving. And without their contributions, the federal government may not have enough resources to serve the needy. Lawmakers should consider these problems before politicizing the care of the elderly and children."},

", "Sex is a biological fact, not a feeling. Women and girls around the world face discrimination and harm as a result of historical and cultural factors."], "text": "The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) is being pressured to embrace “gender identity” ideology at its annual meeting this week. If successful, the move could erase women from international law and economic development. Gender identity refers to an individual’s perception of themselves as male, female, both, neither, or something in between. Historically, U.N. efforts to foster gender equality have focused on biological women. If this focus shifts to equality for all possible gender identities, women lose. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) activists and some Western nations are spearheading the U.N. bureaucracy’s reinterpretation of “sex” in treaties such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. And although U.N. member-states have never voted to adopt these new definitions, U.N. entities that police compliance with human-rights treaties have added “sexual orientation” to the definition of “sex.” They have also read “gender identity” into non-discrimination provisions. These actions are neither binding on member-states nor authoritative, but they do influence member-states’ domestic policies and affect their eligibility for development assistance. At CSW, non-govermment organizations such as Outright International are calling for recognition of gender identity, arguing that they suffer from a “foreclosed definition of ‘women.’” For the first time, the U.N. LGBTI Core Group, of which the U.S. had been a member since the Obama administration, also made a similar statement. Advancing the notion that gender is fluid is not a priority for women in non-Western countries. Unsurprisingly then, the LGBTI Core Group’s statement received a tepid reception from the global gathering. Accusations of cultural imperialism have often been unfairly cast upon the universal human rights movement. But advancing a progressive ideology that conflicts with a scientific understanding of sex gives critics ammunition to attack the CSW’s noble goals. If the U.N. begins to treat biological men as if they are women because they perceive themselves to be women, then the discussion of women’s economic empowerment will turn into one about everyone’s economic empowerment. That defeats the purpose of having separate discussions about women’s roles in the informal economy and as caregivers for children and the elderly, to say nothing of improving women’s access to credit, pensions, and unemployment benefits, a priority theme of the CSW. Legally recognizing gender identity also endangers women and girls. In nations that recognize the concept of gender identity, male sexual predators have exploited the laws to gain access to private spaces. In England, this led to sexual assaults against women in prison, and in the U.S. against a 5-year old girl in her school bathroom. This is not to accuse those who identify as transgender of desiring to harm women. But giving men access to female-only spaces removes critical barriers designed to protect women. The rights of those who identify as transgender must be protected like everyone else’s simply because they are human. But their legitimate claims to human rights are not based on their membership in any particular group, nor should they justify reducing the rights of women and girls. Furthermore, transgender ideology perpetuates gender stereotypes that feminists have long fought against, such as what constitutes “women’s work” or what sports are appropriate for girls. Sex is a biological fact, not a feeling. Women and girls around the world face discrimination and harm as a result of historical and cultural factors related to biological sex. Therefore, international law and economic development policy should continue to be based on this reality. At CSW, the U.S. delegation should focus on advancing opportunities for biological women and girls, as they have rightly pledged to do. Women around the world still need to secure their legal and economic rights, to gain access to quality medical care and education, and to combat violence. To respond to their most pressing needs, the U.S. must protect women from being erased in international law through a radical redefinition of sex."},

"], "text": "The Trump administration has made good on its promise to implement pro-life policies throughout the federal government, including in America’s foreign policy and in humanitarian aid. But those advances could be dealt a crippling blow as a result of a compromise by Senate Republicans, who are cooperating with an underhanded attempt to stymie the administration’s efforts through controversial additions to must-pass appropriations bills. The Trump administration’s Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy reinstated and expanded the Reagan administration’s “Mexico City policy,” which barred taxpayer funds from organizations that perform or promote abortions overseas. In addition, the administration has expanded the availability of funding to pro-life and faith-based aid organizations that the Obama administration excluded from participation in programs at the U.S. Agency for International Development because of their views on abortion, marriage, and gender identity. Over the summer, the White House and congressional leadership from both parties reached an agreement regarding the budget and appropriations process, including an agreement that neither side would include so-called poison pill policy riders that did not have bipartisan support. Abortion-related amendments historically have been understood to clearly violate such agreements, and the inclusion of controversial language on sexual orientation and gender identity should also fall into this category. But prior to the Senate Appropriations Committee’s Sept. 26 vote on the funding bill for the State Department and foreign operations, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., threatened to offer an amendment reversing the Trump administration’s Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy. In order to avoid a vote on this amendment, which could have passed the committee, Republicans on the panel agreed to add new language proposed by Shaheen to the bill. That language, released just minutes before the scheduled committee markup, represents an attempt to work around the administration’s prohibition on international abortion funding by providing $665 million for “family planning and reproductive health care”—which would go to groups that promote abortion. The new amendment, ultimately adopted as part of the final bill, also enshrines problematic language on sexual orientation and gender identity and hinders the administration’s efforts to expand USAID funding to pro-life and faith-based groups. One provision requires the agency to inform Congress if any group that receives funding has been found to violate an Obama-era regulation interpreting sex discrimination as including sexual orientation and gender identity. The Supreme Court is considering whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act’s prohibition on sex discrimination includes sexual orientation and gender identity. This new language, if passed into law, could undermine the Justice Department’s argument in Harris Funeral Homes v. EEOC that Congress has not previously affirmed that reading of the law. The Shaheen amendment also requires creation of a “shame list” by requiring reporting to Congress that would expose pro-life and faith-based recipients of USAID funding to complaints that they refuse to comply with Obama administration regulations requiring them to make referrals for abortion and endorse radical sexual orientation and gender identity ideology. The Shaheen amendment is only one aspect of this troubling compromise by Senate appropriators, however. The committee report attached to the bill, which contains instructions on how funds are to be used, recommends an increase in funding for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex portfolio in USAID’s Human Rights Division. Countries found to engage in “official government discrimination” against LGBT individuals could lose access to USAID funding. It’s unclear whether that includes countries that define marriage as between one man and one woman or whose laws define sex as binary and biological. Finally, the report requires creation of a pilot program to align women’s economic empowerment programs with global health programs that include family planning and reproductive health. That appears to be an attempt to tie funding for programs such as the Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, which focuses on enabling women around the world to support themselves and their families, to promotion of and funding for abortion. The Senate should uphold its end of the bargain made with the White House last summer. That stipulates no funding for abortion-promoting groups, no radical redefinition of marriage and gender, and no shady attempts to implement such policies through a process that’s meant to exclude them."},

Anderson, Ph.D."], "date": "May 7, 2019 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/nancy-pelosis-equality-act-would-undo-trumps-most-significant-achievements", "takeaways": [], "text": "Back in October, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told an audience at Harvard University that if the Democrats retook the House, one of her top legislative priorities would be to pass the misnamed Equality Act, a bill that would impose radical sexual ideology on the nation. Democrats took the House, and Pelosi wasn’t bluffing. She’s now pushing a bill that would undo some of the most significant achievements of the Trump administration. Here’s how. The Equality Act adds the phrase “sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity)” to our nation’s civil rights laws that ban discrimination on the basis of race. This means the law would suddenly treat people as racists if they dare to dissent from the left’s ideology on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Here are the major Trump victories that the Equality Act would undo. 1. The Equality Act would force employers to cover abortion, and medical professionals to perform or assist in performing abortions. When the Obama administration tried to force this same policy in its very last months in office, a federal judge declared it unlawful. When the Trump administration came into office, the Trump Justice Department agreed with that judge and did not appeal his ruling, which placed a 50-state injunction on that regulation. Should the Equality Act become law, this abortion policy would become the law of the land, undermining President Donald Trump’s significant pro-life record. 2. The Equality Act would force employers to pay for sex “reassignment” procedures in their health insurance plans, and require medical professionals to perform them. Think Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters of the Poor, but only worse. If a health care plan covers mastectomies in the case of cancer, but not in the case of “reassignment,” the Equality Act would deem this illegal “discrimination.” So, too, if a doctor chooses to perform mastectomies in the case of cancer but not for sex “reassignment” purposes. That doctor would be guilty of illegal “discrimination.” Thankfully, when the Obama administration attempted to impose this mandate, a federal judge struck it down, and the Trump administration agreed with the judge and did not appeal the ruling. Should the Equality Act become law, it would undo Trump’s policy of protecting the freedom of medical doctors to not perform “reassignment” procedures if they deem them bad medicine. 3. The Equality Act would force all schools and businesses to open their women’s bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, and sports teams to boys who “identify as” girls and to men who “identify as” women. The Obama administration imposed this transgender mandate on schools in all 50 states, and thankfully the Trump administration reversed the misguided policy during its first weeks of office. But, should the Equality Act become law, it would override the Trump policy and would threaten the privacy, safety, and equality of women and girls across the country. 4. The Equality Act could be used to force the military to pay for “reassignment” procedures and force the military to accept recruits suffering from gender dysphoria who are not combat-ready. The Trump administration has implemented a careful, nuanced policy that allows people who identify as transgender to serve in the military—provided they no longer suffer from gender dysphoria and serve in accordance with their biological sex. But should the Equality Act become law, this Trump policy could be deemed “discrimination.” 5. The Equality Act would force faith-based adoption agencies to either violate their conviction that every child deserves both a mother and a father or to stop serving children in need altogether. Thankfully, the Trump administration has taken initial steps to protect adoption agencies from these misguided policies. Additional steps are needed. But if the Equality Act became law, it would force all adoption agencies in all 50 states to either violate their convictions or close their doors. 6. The Equality Act would force a variety of small business owners to violate their beliefs about marriage, sexuality, and gender. At the state level, this has happened to bakers, florists, photographers, and even funeral home owners. Thankfully the Trump administration has supported these small business owners as their cases proceeded through the court system. But should the Equality Act become law, it would bring the full force of the federal government against these small business owners, treating them as violators of federal civil rights law. 7. The Equality Act, in general, threatens the freedom of speech, freedom of association, and free exercise of religion rights of countless people. Anyone who believes we are created male and female, and that male and female are created for each other, will be at risk. This means Orthodox Jews, Roman Catholics, Evangelical Christians, Latter-day Saints, Muslims, and people of no particular faith tradition but who take science seriously will be on the wrong side of federal civil rights law. Thankfully, the Trump administration has championed freedom of speech, free exercise of religion, and the rights of conscience. All of this would be at risk should the Equality Act become law."},

Parents should be able to shield them from premature sexualization and gender confusion."], "text": "Equality is a powerful principle, but the so-called Equality Act profoundly distorts it. All people are equal and should be treated with dignity and respect. But not all ideas are equal, and the government should not force Americans to affirm politically correct and scientifically inaccurate views on sexual matters. The Equality Act, under consideration in the House of Representatives, will codify political ideology by adding sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes in the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It could force schools to open girls’ bathrooms, locker rooms, and sports teams to biological males who identify as women. Moreover, it could politicize the education of at least 50 million public school students by forcing school districts to follow curricula that introduce students to the concept of sexual preferences and transgender theory, starting as early as pre-K. It’s already happening at the state and local level — and parents are fighting back. In the name of “inclusion” for students who identity as gay or transgender, five states (New Jersey, Illinois, Colorado, California, and Washington) and the District of Columbia have ordered that schools teach sexual orientation and gender in numerous classes. These laws weave LGBT teachings into all subjects with no opt-outs. Parents in 10 other states (Alabama, Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Florida, and North Carolina) have succeeded in putting limits on this curriculum, but the Equality Act would erase those protections. The protesting parents, including some with kids who identify as transgender, don’t want schools deciding what and when their children are taught about sexuality, much less infusing every classroom with LGBT perspectives. For example, some states require teaching that Francis Bacon and Emily Dickinson were gay. As Victoria Jakelsky, a New Jersey mom, notes: “When you teach about George Washington, you don’t teach that George Washington had sex with his wife and what he did [in the bedroom]; we teach what George Washington did as a president.” Virginia mom Maria Keffler points out the website genderspectrum.org identifies curriculum as one of the four “entry points” to get transgender theory into schools. “Entry points,” she says, “are what a thief uses to break into your house. It feels very much the same way to me.” But LGBT activists accuse these parents of bigotry. For LGBT-identifying students to be fully “included,” they say, requires that 100% of all students be taught to choose their gender identity. But, when a kindergarten teacher in Rocklin, Calif., read I Am Jazz to students, they went home crying, afraid that they “could turn into” the opposite sex without knowing it. Five-year-olds are imaginative, vulnerable, and innocent. Parents should be able to shield them from premature sexualization and gender confusion, not have the government force it on them via their curriculum. What LGBT activists don’t teach students and parents are the facts about the irreversible path of “gender transition.” Jazz Jennings, the subject of I Am Jazz, started taking puberty blockers at 11. Eventually, Jennings took cross-sex hormones and underwent “gender-confirmation” surgery. Complications from the attempt to construct female genitalia from male genitalia caused “crazy pain,” Jennings says. Students also won’t be told that hormone treatments can lead to impaired cognitive ability, greater risk of cancer, and sterility. Roughly 80-95% of gender-dysphoric children who go through puberty without hormones eventually become comfortable with their bodies. But, the Equality Act could bar counselors from helping kids become comfortable with their bodies. It could also put medical professionals who decline to perform hormonal and surgical sex-reassignment procedures in violation of civil rights law. Trans-activists describe parents who don’t want their children to go down the path of “gender transition” as abusive, equating their choices with denying life-saving treatment for cancer or asthma. In Ohio, one judge already terminated parents’ custody of their daughter after they refused testosterone treatments. The Equality Act would lead to more kids being socialized at school into thinking they are gender fluid at earlier ages and make it harder for parents to find non-invasive treatments for them. Children are loved, nurtured, and raised by their parents, not the state. Therefore, parents have the duty and the right to educate their children and to seek the best possible medical treatments for them. The Equality Act would wield a misguided understanding of “equality” against parents. Congress should not be misled. Treating students and their parents with dignity and respect means allowing them to learn and to live according to their own beliefs about sexual matters. Codifying LGBT ideology into a civil right would take away fundamental freedoms from those who don’t conform. That’s not equality; it’s injustice."},

These Brave Athletes Are Standing Firm.", "author": ["Monica  Burke", "Nicholas  Marr"], "date": "Jul 19, 2019 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/womens-sports-are-facing-crisis-these-brave-athletes-are-standing-firm", "takeaways": [], "text": "The U.S. women’s national soccer team recently earned a historic victory on the world stage, but not all is well for girls who might want to follow in its footsteps. In fact, girls sports has become one of the most tragic battlefields of the culture war. In Connecticut, high school track runner Selina Soule recently joined two other girls in filing a civil rights complaint with the Department of Education. Soule lost out on potential college scholarships and recruitment opportunities after she lost a race—and a spot in the state championship—to two transgender, biological males. These girls argue that the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference has violated Title IX’s prohibition on sex-based discrimination by allowing biological males to compete in female competitions. Connecticut isn’t the only state to go down this path. The nation’s capital has adopted a similar policy allowing boys to compete with girls, prompting the all-girls Oakcrest School to withdraw from its athletic conference over concerns about “safety and fairness.” This issue has united conservatives and progressives alike who believe that biological sex determines important social realities. Telling girls they must compete with boys and share locker rooms and bathrooms with boys is wrong, they say. It’s not fair, and it fails to account for the privacy and safety concerns many women have in intimate facilities. Having to compete against boys isn’t the only obstacle women are beginning to face. What if you had to wear a certain design on your jersey that endorses a message unrelated to your sport, your team, or your ability to play in order to participate? This is what happened to Jaelene Hinkle, who was invited to play soccer for the U.S. women’s national team but withdrew, citing her reluctance to compete in a jersey adorned with LGBT pride colors. Last summer, Hinkle was interviewed by the Christian Broadcasting Network about her life, her passion for soccer, and her Christian faith. A clip from that interview resurfaced a few days ago on Twitter. The clip documented Hinkle’s decision to withdraw from competition for the women’s national team in 2018—she did not feel that she could wear a jersey bearing pride colors in good conscience. The jersey change was not made by the players, but by higher-ups in the organization in a nod to Pride Month celebrations. Ashlyn Harris, a goalie for the team, wrote in response, “Hinkle, our team is about inclusion. Your religion was never the problem. The problem is your intolerance and you are homophobic. You don’t belong in a sport that aims to unite and bring people together. You would never fit into our pack or what this team stands for.” But is Hinkle really intolerant for declining to display a message that she disagreed with? Is she homophobic for not wanting to actively celebrate conduct that she and many others of the same faith, other faiths, and even no faith might find objectionable? These are not fair conclusions. Hinkle didn’t force anyone else to withdraw, or to not wear the jerseys or even change the jerseys. As she explains well in the short Christian Broadcasting Network interview, she felt that she could not in good conscience don a jersey that celebrated behavior with which she disagreed. She was there to represent her country. She wanted to play for those stars and stripes that, at their best,­­ unite all Americans—not the rainbow that often divides them. Hinkle now plays defender for the North Carolina Courage. It’s a fitting team name for her. As an American, she has the legal right to live by her faith and her moral convictions. The First Amendment to our Constitution protects the free exercise of religion and the freedom of speech. But the efficacy of these protections will ultimately depend on public opinion. If people don’t value religious freedom or free speech—if they believe only certain kinds of religious expression or speech are worth protecting—then there’s only so much the law can do. Culture informs how judges apply the law, and in the long term, we can’t expect these protections to last if culture turns squarely against them. As if to underscore this hostility, Fox Sports commentator Rachel Bonnetta tweeted in response to Hinkle’s leaving the team, “Why’d they even give this girl a mic?” They gave her a mic because they knew she had a story to tell. They knew she had a story that was worth listening to. Hinkle is an example for people of faith, and for young girls across America who might face similar challenges in the years ahead. “If I never get a national team call-up again, that is just part of his plan, and that’s OK. And maybe this was why you were meant to play soccer.”"},

"], "text": "Despite its cunningly ingenious name, the Paycheck Fairness Act is not about equal pay for equal work. That’s already the law of the land under both the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Moreover, few Americans living today think people should be paid more than others solely because of their gender — or their race, height, eye color, shoe size, or any other biological factor. Pay should be based on one thing and one thing only: productivity. Since pay discrimination already is illegal, you might wonder what the Paycheck Fairness Act really will bring about. The answer, unfortunately, is rigid pay scales, hiring discrimination, lower wages, lower productivity, increased business and consumer costs, and lawyers and judges second-guessing employers’ evaluations. That is a lot of consequences, all in the name of reducing the so-called “pay gap” between men and women. That “pay gap” refers to an apples-to-oranges comparison purporting to show that, compared to men, women make about 20 cents less on the dollar. The finding hinges on completely ignoring factors that employers consider when setting pay — factors such as occupation, education, experience and hours. When such measurable factors are taken into account, the “gap” all but disappears. For example, a 2009 Department of Labor study estimated a 5- to 7-cent gap. A payscale.com study last year found a mere 2-cent adjusted pay gap. But even those adjusted pay gaps aren’t necessarily the result of discrimination. Harder-to-measure factors such as differences in workplace flexibility and benefits likely account for some of the remaining gap. Those harder-to-measure job factors would be the first to go under the Paycheck Fairness Act. Losing the option of flexible work schedules, teleworking, and family-friendly benefits would disproportionately hurt working mothers, who tend to place a higher value on those factors. The end desire of proponents of the Paycheck Fairness Act seems to be collective pay scales, similar to those established for the federal workforce or in union contracts. But even the federal government has a 13 percent pay gap — attributed primarily to differences in occupational choices of men and women. And a study of unionized public transportation drivers found that women made 11 cents less on the dollar compared to men — the entirety of which was explained by women choosing to work less overtime and take more unpaid leave. What’s wrong with rigid pay scales? They are not amenable to today’s labor market. Unlike a 1950 assembly line where workers clocked in at 9 a.m. and out at 5 p.m., and all produced 20 widgets a day, fewer jobs today have exactly equal functions or outputs. Moreover, fixed-pay regimes don’t let employers offer flexibility or rewards for extra effort. Instead, they create less productive and often frustrating work environments. Take the federal pay system, which is based almost entirely on title and tenure. The 2018 Federal Employee Viewpoint survey showed that only one of every four non-supervisory employees believes that pay raises depend on how well people do their jobs, and only 34 percent believe that promotions are based on merit or that differences in work are recognized in a meaningful way. That’s not only a problem for workers who reap little benefit for excelling in their work. It’s bad for overall productivity, workers’ wages and the economy. Studies show that rigid pay structures result in 6 to 10 percent lower pay and productivity compared to performance-based pay. The combination of lower productivity and significant compliance costs put a double-whammy on workers’ wages. And instead of higher pay, women and minorities likely would find it harder to get their foot in the door. Employers would be more reticent to hire women and minorities — especially those just re-entering the workforce — since they automatically would be included in future gender- or race-based class-action lawsuits. The primary beneficiaries of the Paycheck Fairness Act would be trial lawyers who could data-mine through private employers’ pay information and then include all women in class-action lawsuits seeking unlimited damages. At the end of the day, most workers just want to be paid based on the work they perform. The best way to achieve that is to let workers negotiate directly with their employers instead of having lawyers and judges scrutinize and second-guess the agreements that employers and workers make with each other. Enacting laws that take away opportunities and choices for all workers is no way to help women. Lawmakers truly interested in helping women should take up policies that promote choice, such as the Working Families Flexibility Act and proposals to let workers choose who represents them in employer-employee negotiations. Moreover, state policymakers should eliminate unnecessary regulations that drive up the cost of child care. All workers want and deserve equal pay for equal work, but having the government determine workers’ value and paychecks will result in equal pay for unequal work."},

Instead, it would promote inequality by undermining parental rights, forcing the hand of medical professionals, and erasing women. How? By imposing government-mandated gender identity policies in schools, hospitals and women’s spaces across the country. The Equality Act would add “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” as protected classes in the federal Civil Rights Act. It would also expand the definition of “public accommodations.” While this bill may sound harmless, these changes would have far-reaching negative effects on average Americans. For example, the Equality Act could be used as a tool to force schools nationwide to teach kids about LGBT ideology without parental consent. Judges have interpreted the 1964 Civil Rights Act, a landmark bill that ended segregation and served as a direct response to racism in America, as requiring schools to implement black history curriculum. If activist judges interpret the Equality Act in the same way, schools would have no choice but to implement LGBT curriculum, not only in sex education classes, but across the board — in literature, history, etc. — without an option to opt out. When it comes to sensitive and personal topics such as sex, parents should be free to decide when and how to talk with their children. A change like this would rob parents of their right to make those decisions, with potentially damaging consequences for kids. In Rocklin County, California, children came home crying and afraid that they were going to change sex after a teacher hosted a “gender transition celebration” for a kindergarten student. The teacher read two books to the class, including \"I Am Jazz\" to students, a picture book about a transgender reality TV star named Jazz Jennings. The teacher then asked the kindergartner to leave the room. When the student returned in girl’s clothing, the teacher instructed children to refer to the boy by a new female name. Parents were given no prior notice of the event and no chance to weigh in with any concerns. The Equality Act would also politicize medicine for adults and children. By expanding public accommodations to include health care, this bill would impose a nationwide gender identity mandate. It would require doctors and nurses to perform and provide sex-reassignment procedures and hormone therapy against their conscience or even their best medical judgment. It would require hospitals to offer these procedures and insurers to cover them. This would also affect pediatrics and parental rights. If the government can force providers to offer hormonal and surgical interventions for adults, the expectation will come to include those same interventions for children. Activists promote social transition to children as young as 4, puberty-blocking drugs as young as 9, cross sex-hormones as young as 14, and surgery at 18 or younger. These therapies come with serious medical risks, including include increased risk for cancer, liver and cardiovascular disease, and of course, sterility. These side effects ought to make any parent take pause. What about women’s rights? The Equality Act would erase women and effectively end any women’s-only spaces. When biological males can claim entry into women’s facilities, including locker rooms, bathrooms and so on, women can no longer expect privacy in these places. Gender identity policies endanger women by making it more difficult to establish malicious intent when sexual predators take advantage of self-identified gender identity policies to access female spaces. Women will also lose the opportunity to participate in fair and equal athletic competitions. Enduring biological differences between the sexes — in hormones, bone structure, and musculature — give biological males a competitive advantage over females in most sports When males who identify as women are allowed to compete against females, women lose. Just ask Selina Soule, a 16-year-old track athlete who lost her spot to compete at the state championship to two transgender athletes. “It’s very frustrating and heartbreaking when [we] girls are at the start of the race, and we already know that these athletes are going to come out and win no matter how hard you try,” she said. The Equality Act is anything but harmless. It would undermine parents’ ability to do what is best for their children. It would force medical professionals to offer procedures and prescriptions even when they conflict with their professional opinion about what is best for a given patient. It would erase women by opening up women’s spaces and sports to men nationwide. Do not be fooled by a name. The Equality Act would only promote inequality."},

"], "text": "The Supreme Court rejected a case regarding school policy in a district which allows transgender students to use bathrooms of their choice. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court denied cert to Doe v. Boyertown Area School District, a case concerning a gender identity bathroom and locker room policy at a Pennsylvania high school. In declining to take up the case, The Supreme Court let stand the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit’s decision, which dismissed the concerns of students who did not wish to share intimate spaces with members of the opposite sex. As long as this policy remains in place, the problems with the policy remain too. High school girls like Alexis Lightcap will continue to have to share women’s spaces with biological males. “I don’t want a man in the bathroom with me. I’m already uncomfortable in my body, trying to grow up,” said Lightcap.  “I have a thirteen-year-old sister who goes to this school. I don’t want her going into a bathroom where a male is allowed to just walk in there.” “I wish that the school had protected my privacy somehow. It felt like a specific group of people were protected while the greater population was not,” Lightcap said. Policies like the one at Boyertown Area School District leaves girls vulnerable to emotional trauma–or worse. At a school in Decatur, Georgia, a gender identity bathroom policy similar to the one at Boyertown enabled a boy who identifies as gender fluid to sexually assault a kindergarten girl. Girls deserve to feel safe and have privacy in women’s only spaces. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg understood this. When she penned the majority opinion requiring Virginia Military Institute to admit women, she stipulated that VMI would need to “afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in living arrangements.” Why? As she wrote in an op-ed at The Washington Post while she was a law professor at Columbia, “Separate places to disrobe, sleep, perform personal bodily functions are permitted, in some situations required, by regard for individual privacy. Individual privacy, a right of constitutional dimension, is appropriately harmonized with the equality principle.” Privacy and equality are not mutually exclusive. In fact, upholding the former is essential to preserving the latter—especially for women. The #MeToo movement is a prescient reminder that women still face unique social challenges. Taking away women’s privacy from the male form and the male gaze directly by forcing them to share spaces with males is a step backwards in the fight for equality. This problem is not going anywhere. As Ginsburg pointed out in her VMI opinion, “[p]hysical differences between the sexes are enduring,” and quoting Ballard v. United States, “[t]he two sexes are not fungible.” The difference between the sexes is here to stay; so too are the problems with gender identity policies like the one at Boyertown. Everyone deserves privacy and safety in private facilities. However, one-size-fits-all policies like Boyertown’s fail to take into account the very real needs of countless girls. Better solutions exist. In the absence of a Supreme Court decision, it is on school administrators to find them."},

The House of Representatives is expected to pass H.R. 7 on Wednesday, misnamed as the Paycheck Fairness Act, along almost totally partisan lines. The bill is a misguided, one-size-fits-all attempt to punish employers for any discrepancies in pay between men and women, regardless of what may be justifiable and legitimate reasons. The proposal is based on a fundamental untruth that there is currently a significant wage gap based on sexual discrimination. There is no “pay gap,” but instead a choice gap where salary differences between men and women are best explained by differences in education, choice of occupation, time in the official workforce, hours worked, and flexibility. No one is arguing that women and men should be paid differently for the same work, despite the media and far left’s attempt to frame the debate this way. Both the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 already prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex in the workplace. What H.R. 7 attempts is a classic “swampball” play: Introduce a law titled after something no one can disagree with (like the Violence Against Women Act or the Clean Water Act) and then use it to usher in huge new government controls that benefit special interests. In this case, trial lawyers benefit the most. The law would allow for a cause of action for anyone who is paid less than someone in their workplace in a similar job, and would remove a previously existing $300,000 cap on damages, also automatically including all “injured parties” in a class-action discrimination lawsuit. It would allow for onerous data collection and surrender by private companies to the federal government to make available for sifting through by litigious trial lawyers, essentially having the taxpayer subsidizing the discovery portion of litigation for them. In short, it would be a huge boon for trial lawyers. Notably, lawyers appear as top donors on many of the co-sponsors’ campaign and PAC donor reports, including a whopping $78,522 to Rep. Rosa Delauro’s, D-Conn., 2018 campaign committee, according to Open Secrets. The House is free to establish its own pay structure so long as it’s consistent with applicable federal law. So the question is, why haven’t they imposed an H.R. 7 pay equality schedule on themselves? And if they did, what would happen? The House provides a great test case for what an H.R. 7 regime could look like in practice. The congressional body divides its staff neatly into certain job titles and regular career progressions. It is much easier to make comparisons on such a clean model than would be in other complex business organizations with varied titles, divisions, and structures. In order to understand how legislative staff is paid and how the implementation of H.R. 7 would impact lawmakers, we pulled publicly available salary data from the third quarter of last year for 176 of H.R. 7’s co-sponsors. The publicly available data, pulled from LegiStorm, is only available for members who were in Congress last year. Additionally, there are some anomalies (part-time staff, shared staff, partial employment during period, etc.), which were excluded from the dataset. The data identifies a few trends that are inconsistent with the messaging surrounding the bill and would actually result in downward pressure for some female salaries. Of the co-sponsors’ offices, female staff assistants make an average of $1,218 more than their male counterparts, female legislative correspondents $3,416 more, legislative assistants $4,755 more, and chiefs of staff $2,268 more. Only male legislative and communications directors make more than their female counterparts, $5,761 and $693, respectively. So the question is: What accounts for these differences if not insidious discrimination based on sex? There are countless possible justifiable explanations for these differences, but H.R. 7 would put the onus on proving that discrimination is not the reason behind any difference, it must be due to sex-based discrimination, and therefore should be remedied. The result? Under H.R. 7, male staffers could sue their members on the grounds of wage discrimination. Unless members of congress could prove that it was a business necessity to pay female staffers more and that there was nothing they could have done to remedy pay (such as providing training to male staffers to bring their skills on par with female staffers), the members would not only have to reduce female staffers’ wages to bring them on par with male staffers’ wages, but they would have to compensate male staffers for past differences in wages, as well as potential unlimited punitive damages. Again, the biggest beneficiaries would be trial lawyers who would walk away with much larger settlements than any individual staffer. There is no reason to suspect that there is a rampant and sex-based discriminatory pay issue on Capitol Hill that is driving these members to compensate their staffs differently. And no serious person would call for lowering female staffers’ salaries based upon these numbers. What these numbers do tell us is that a strict, central planning model would often result in fundamentally unfair and, in some instances, absurd applications. Moreover, it tells us that H.R. 7 is another instance of out-of-touch Washington lawmakers telling American businesses how to run their operations while they themselves do the exact opposite."},
{"title": "Pelosi’s Equality Act Could Lead to More Parents Losing Custody of Kids Who Want \"Gender Transition\"", "author": ["Emilie  Kao"], "date": "Jan 15, 2019 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/marriage-and-family/commentary/pelosis-equality-act-could-lead-more-parents-losing-custody-kids-who", "takeaways": [], "text": "Americans have long understood that children are best cared for by their parents. The state can only intervene in the family when there is demonstrable evidence of abuse and neglect. This has long been established in our laws. But now, transgender ideology is silencing doctors and challenging the way courts define parental abuse and neglect. Last year in Ohio, a judge removed a biological girl from her parents’ custody after they declined to help her “transition” to male with testosterone supplements. The Cincinnati Children’s gender clinic recommended these treatments for gender dysphoria (the condition of being distressed with one’s biological sex). When her parents wanted to treat her with counseling instead, the county prosecutor charged them with abuse and neglect, while transgender activists and pro-trans doctors compared their decision to denying treatment for asthma or even cancer patients. That all happened without federal legislation. But now, one of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s top legislative priorities, the Equality Act, could give the transgender community a vice grip over the medical profession. It could open the floodgates for lawsuits against doctors who don’t fall in line with transgender ideology. Politicizing the medical treatment of gender dysphoria could lead to more prosecutions against parents who refuse to aid in the sterilization of their children. As more doctors recommend that children take puberty blockers at age 11, cross-sex hormones at 16, and undergo “sex-reassignment” surgeries at 18, parents who resist could face charges of child abuse and lose custody of their children. The tragedy in Ohio could be repeated in families across America. Turning the Law Into a Sword Against Doctors The transgender movement wants to dominate the field of medicine, and to do so it is threatening doctors and hospitals with penalties. Some states have already passed laws similar to Pelosi’s Equality Act. In New Jersey and California, transgender activists have sued Catholic hospitals for “discrimination” on the basis of gender identity because they wouldn’t perform sex-change surgeries for patients with gender dysphoria. These lawsuits may seem preposterous, but they were enabled by state anti-discrimination laws that treat sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes and health care facilities as public accommodations. The text of the Equality Act that was introduced in the 115th Congress does the same. Pelosi’s bill would add sexual orientation and gender identity to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, making hospitals and doctors across America vulnerable to costly litigation if they don’t follow the medical recommendations of the transgender movement. It would turn anti-discrimination law—which was meant to protect disenfranchised minority groups—into a coercive sword to threaten doctors into submission to transgender ideology. Does Transgender Ideology Make for Good Medicine? Part of the reason some doctors resist transgender ideology is that it is incompatible with good medicine and would harm rather than help their patients. The American Psychological Association’s manual of mental disordersclassifies gender dysphoria as a mental illness. Research shows that 75 to 95 percent of children with gender dysphoria who go through puberty without any transgender treatments actually become comfortable with their bodies. But the transgender movement ignores these statistics, aggressively pushing for gender-dysphoric children to be treated with non-FDA-approved uses of drugs, even though side effects can include loss of bone density, decline of cognitive ability, and infertility. Dr. Michelle Cretella, executive director of the American College of Pediatricians, describes it as “institutionalized child abuse.” Transgender activists have already tried to silence doctors who warned patients about these dangers. The Human Rights Campaign—a leading LGBT group—devotes an entire website to trying to discredit Dr. Paul McHugh, the former lead psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University Hospital who put a stop to the hospital’s sex-reassignment surgeries. McHugh says the surgeries were “fundamentally cooperating with a mental illness.” Trans Activists Are Putting Children and Doctors in the Driver’s Seat Transgender activists and pro-trans physicians often seek to exclude parents from the process of medical decision-making. Cincinnati Children’s Hospital’s Transgender Health Clinic says parents may be excluded from interviews because they might make their children feel uncomfortable asking questions. Remarkably, this clinic has deemed 100 percent of the patients seeking care to be “appropriate candidates for continued gender treatment.” Even the Ohio judge who terminated one couple’s parental rights expressed “concern” at this astoundingly high approval rate. Transgender advocates dismiss these concerns by sounding an alarm that gender-dysphoric children will be at higher risk of suicide if they don’t receive hormone treatment. But the evidence suggests transgender treatments can actually increase the likelihood of suicide. A study in Sweden on adults who underwent sex-reassignment surgeries showed they were 19 times more likely than the general population to commit suicide after undergoing operations. This is particularly noteworthy because in Sweden, cultural support for those who identify as transgender is very strong, so social stigma is less likely to account for the suicides. We should be particularly cautious with experimental treatments on children because the long-term effects of transgender treatments have yet to be seen. Even the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid under the Obama administration pointed out that “mortality from this patient population did not become apparent until after 10 years.” Endocrinologist Dr. Michael Laidlaw also warns that the long-term harms to kids may not show up until years later when as young adults, they start asking: “’How come I can’t have children at this point?’ Well, it’s because their fertility was destroyed by some combination of puberty blockers, wrong sex hormones, and surgery.” And Dr. Stephen B. Levine, professor of psychiatry at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, asks the pertinent question: Are children really capable of comprehending the way that hormone treatments will alter their lives and render them unable to have their own children? There’s a reason we have informed consent laws—to protect people, like children, from being taken advantage of. Expediting a Bad Trend In this cultural and political climate, doctors and courts are more and more likely to seek to exclude parents from life-changing decisions about their children. America has seen an explosion of “gender clinics” and diagnoses of “gender dysphoria” in just the past few years. In 2013, America had only three gender clinics. Today, there are more than 41. These clinics report 400 percent increases in children and teens identifying as trans. The Equality Act would expedite this trend by giving the transgender movement a powerful legal weapon to drive medical consensus that could undermine the rights of parents. As more parents wrestle with finding the most loving and helpful solutions for their children struggling with gender dysphoria, the government must support them—not undermine them. Parents must remain central to the decision-making process when it comes to the medical care of children suffering from gender dysphoria."},

The bill’s proponents insist it’s meant simply to protect the rights of the LGBT community. But by embracing the ideology of “gender identity,” it treats womanhood as a mutable feeling rather than an immutable fact. This, in the end, will only increase the very real dangers and disadvantages women face. Our female-only spaces — bathrooms, locker rooms and dormitories — are places where we expect to be free from the male gaze, naked male bodies and sexual assault. For the most vulnerable among us, privacy is the difference between recovery and renewed trauma. Consider the homeless women served by the Downtown Hope Center in Anchorage, Alaska. They have survived rape, domestic violence and sex trafficking. Having a space of their own is a matter of mental health and personal safety. One woman said she would prefer to sleep in the woods rather than sleep next to a man. Yet under a local gender identity ordinance, a man who identifies as a woman is suing the shelter for admittance. No one accuses him of being a sexual predator, but changing rules for admittance has consequences. After Britain passed the Gender Recognition Act, a convicted male rapist who claimed to be transgender was transferred to a women’s prison where he twice committed sexual assault. Why would we want to bring this to the U.S. with a new federal law? Those who identify as transgender should be treated with dignity, respect and compassion. Many suffer from gender dysphoria. Their minds are so troubled that some even undergo incredibly painful procedures to change their bodies. Redefining “sex” in the law won’t resolve this underlying distress, but it will erase protections for women. Pascha Thomas’s daughter was only five years old when she became the youngest American victim of sexual assault due to a transgender bathroom policy. Her daughter became fearful not only of using public bathrooms, but of going to school. Despite these avoidable tragedies, transgender activists accuse women of malice. The intimidation is shutting down discussions that could address concerns on both sides. And for women who are also sexual assault survivors, being told to stay quiet sounds all too familiar. In the age of #MeToo and #TimesUp, will Congress listen? When Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg told the Virginia Military Institute it would have to become co-ed, she wrote that it “would undoubtedly require alterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in living arrangements.” Justice Ginsburg’s opinion acknowledged a legitimate need for privacy and safety because it is women’s bodies, not our feelings, that can make us vulnerable. Women fought hard to be heard so we could have our own spaces, but the Equality Act would roll back this progress. We also fought hard for equal opportunities in academics and athletics. A year after Title IX of the 1972 Educational Amendments passed, only 300,000 girls participated in interscholastic athletics, compared to 3.6 million boys. The benefits of Title IX to girls are not limited to the playing field. The Girls and Sports Impact Report surveyed more than 10,000 girls and found a positive correlation between playing sports and increased confidence, body image, academic performance and personal relationships. However, males who identify as females are starting to dominate women’s sports. High school sprinter Selina Soule described losing to male competitors as “demoralizing.” She and her teammates lost medals and scholarships as well as their morale. All year long, but this month especially, we tell young women and girls that they can do anything. But if the Equality Act passes, it will put their dreams out of reach. For them to enjoy the progress that their grandmothers, mothers and sisters fought for, we must stand up for the truth that being female isn’t a feeling or a social construct. It’s a biological fact."},

The so-called Equality Act would do just that. The bill now before Congress would elevate nonbiologically-based “gender identity” as a protected class in federal anti-discrimination law, while expanding the “public accommodations” definition to include any establishment that provides health care. In practice, it would politicize medicine and silence any medical professional or health care organization that considers sex to be a biological reality. The bill would require doctors to prescribe cross-sex hormones and perform so-called transition-affirming surgeries—removing healthy reproductive organs and/or creating facsimiles of genitalia—against their best medical judgment. It would also force hospitals to offer these procedures, despite their religious, moral, or medical objections. Physicians, nurses, and other medical professionals must be free to exercise their best medical judgment when treating their patients. The Equality Act would impose one view on the entire profession, not as the result of new scientific discoveries or professional consensus, but by ideological fiat. This health care mandate would implicate insurers, too. Workers could sue their employers if their insurance does not cover “sex-reassignment.” This could translate to years of costly litigation for companies and charities that object to these procedures. Recall how many years it took the courts to grant relief from the Obamacare contraceptive mandate to companies like Hobby Lobby and groups like the Little Sisters of the Poor. Not only does the bill lack any conscience protections for anyone with objections to transition-affirming therapies, it also eliminates protections provided by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. This federal law reiterates that the government cannot burden religious exercise without a compelling reason, and if it must do so, it must use the least restrictive means. Without recourse to this law, it will be even harder for affected individuals to gain relief from the proposed mandate. Litigation has already begun at the state level. Catholic hospitals in New Jersey and California have been sued for declining to perform hysterectomies on otherwise healthy females who wished to pursue gender transition. A third Catholic hospital in Washington settled out of court after the ACLU sued them for declining to perform a double mastectomy on a 16-year old girl with gender dysphoria. Yes, the attempt to politicize medical treatment extends to children. Since the Equality Act lacks any age restrictions, it has the power to compel pediatricians to implement the radical transition-affirming protocol proposed by transgender activists: puberty-blocking drugs to children as young as 9, cross sex-hormones for those as young as 14, and surgery by 18. Studies show that 80 to 95 percent of children with gender dysphoria come to identify with their bodily sex after puberty. Yet activists insist that these children ought to be prescribed off-label puberty-blocking drugs—even though they can cause dangerous side effects ranging from acne and weight gain to breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, liver disease, and, of course, sterility. And the mother of a gender dysphoric daughter asked at a Heritage Foundation panel discussion earlier this month: If it’s not OK for doctors to remove healthy limbs from children, why would it be OK to remove their healthy reproductive organs? Transgender activists tell parents that these measures are the only way to prevent their child from attempting suicide. Yet those who have had transition surgery are 19 times more likely to die by suicide. These numbers show that the debate over these procedures is far from over. Leveraging the government to forcibly override the conversation within the medical community and the broader public would be a huge mistake. Medical professionals would not be the only ones affected by an authoritarian gender-identity health care mandate. The Equality Act could have implications for parents’ decisions about their children’s health care. In Ohio, a couple lost custody of their teenage daughter when they declined to put her on testosterone supplements. We can expect to see more cases like this one if the Equality Act becomes law. The drastic government overreach of the Equality Act would compromise the independence and integrity of the medical profession with serious consequences for children and their families. This is not a win for equality. It is an attack on our freedoms and common sense."},
{"title": "A Closer Read of the “Gender Wage Gap” Tells a Different Story", "author": ["Rachel  Greszler"], "date": "Apr 22, 2019 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/closer-read-the-gender-wage-gap-tells-different-story", "takeaways": [], "text": "Women can’t seem to get a break. They not only have to pay more than men for things like life insurance and haircuts, they earn less, too. It seems so unfair.  But is it? Women pay more for life insurance because of an actuarial fact: they live longer than men. Is there perhaps an equally reasonable explanation for the fact that, compared to men, women make only 80 cents on the dollar? Why, yes, there is. The 20-cent “wage gap” compares the earnings of all men who work at least 35 hours per week to those of all women working 35 hours or more. It makes no allowances for differences in occupation, education or experience, job conditions and risks, or whether an individual works 35 or 55 hours per week. Devoid of such real-life context, the “wage gap” statistic is grossly misleading. The apparent gap is not born of discrimination. Rather, it arises from a difference in life choices. The “gender wage gap” reflects women’s freedom to pursue the education and occupation they desire, and their opportunity to choose a job environment and work schedule that fits their needs and desires. Viewed in this light, the gap is something to be celebrated, not bemoaned. So let’s take a closer look at why those 20 cents are missing. A 2019 National Bureau of Economic Research study concluded that “hours worked” alone accounted for at least half of the wage gap. A 2018 PayScale study factoring in additional variables such as experience, industry and job level found that women receive 97.8 cents for every dollar earned by their male counterparts.. The minimal gap remaining may result from more difficult-to-measure factors such as flexible work hours and generous benefit packages that women tend to value more than do men. Despite overwhelming evidence that the so-called wage gap is really a choice gap, some want the government to step in and “fix” the non-existent problem. And that’s a problem in itself, because their proposed solutions will wind up hurting workers — both women and men. That’s what happened when Denmark tried to reduce its wage gap by requiring companies to report their salaries by gender and race. In a sense, it somewhat worked: the wage gap at those companies fell by 2 percentage points. But the gap narrowed because the companies lowered men’s wages rather than raising women’s. The workers were no better off, and the businesses’ productivity fell as well. Today, virtually everyone — employers included — believes workers should get equal pay for equal work. Indeed, it’s been the law of the land for more than half a century—since the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But that didn’t stop virtue-signaling members of the House of Representatives from approving yet another law — the Paycheck Fairness Act — last month. The proposed law encourages companies to enact rigid pay scales and one-size-fits-all jobs that don’t meet many working women’s (and men’s) needs. It didn’t work in Denmark, and it won’t work here. Instead of generating higher paychecks for women — something they are already enjoying by virtue of their productivity — the bill would almost certainly reduce wages for all workers. Perversely, since the bill emboldens trial lawyers to gin up class action lawsuits, some companies would hesitate to hire women, as a way to preempt groundless yet costly lawsuits. There’s a huge drawback to rigid pay scales, too. Numerous economic studies show performance-based pay produces a 6- to 10% increase in productivity compared to rigid pay scales. Stagnant or lower wages, lost flexibility and reduced economic output — that’s a high price to pay for what would likely be only a marginal decline in the so-called wage gap. I’m not saying gender- and race-based pay discrimination is nonexistent. But individuals who encounter discrimination have both the law and the free market — which penalizes employers who discriminate — on their side. Rather than promote the dishonest narrative that women make less than men for doing the exact same job, let’s celebrate the gains women have made in education, income, and career choices over recent decades. And let’s promote policies that increase opportunities and incomes for all workers."},

", "Without this lawful ability to “discriminate,” we would place our military in jeopardy of not being able to protect the nation.", "Thus far, the courts have seen fit to substitute their judgment on military enlistment criteria in place of that of the commander in chief. That’s unfortunate."], "text": "In normal usage, “discrimination” is an ugly word. But discrimination has two meanings. The first and more familiar definition is “the treatment of a person or particular group of people differently, in a way that is worse than the way people are usually treated.” Discrimination of that sort is clearly unacceptable. The second, less common usage is the “the ability to judge the quality of something, based on its difference from other, similar things.” Earlier this month, several members of Congress introduced a bill to allow transgender individuals to serve in the military. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., one of the bill’s sponsors, said in introducing the bill, “President Trump’s ban on transgender service members is discrimination. It undermines our military readiness, and it is an insult to the brave and patriotic transgender Americans who choose to serve in our military.” What members of Congress like the sponsors of this bill—and indeed, the American public—often seem not to grasp is that discrimination—the less common meaning of the word—takes place every day at military recruiting stations across America. That’s neither unjust, nor prejudicial. And contrary to Gillibrand, who aspires to be our next commander in chief, it’s necessary to ensure the readiness of the military and protect at-risk individuals. Some examples are in order. Have asthma? You’re probably ineligible to join the military. A depressive disorder? Sorry, no. Torn rotator cuff in your shoulder? Nope. Come back perhaps when it heals or is repaired. It’s the difference between an individual who is able to serve, and those for whom service presents a risk—either of not being able to complete military service or of doing so without incurring harm to themselves. In a strict sense, that’s discrimination. By law, the military can accept only “qualified, effective and able-bodied individuals.” That means people who are expected to need more than routine medical care or treatment are not qualified to join. Without this lawful ability to “discriminate,” we would place our military in jeopardy of not being able to protect the nation. That brings us to the issue of service by transgender individuals. Anyone who wants to serve their nation is worthy of our nation’s thanks, because not enough do. A mere desire to serve, however, does not equal qualification. What is often described as “Trump’s transgender ban” is anything but. Underreported is the fact that the policy that the Pentagon wishes to put in place—but that has been thus far been stayed by the court system—is far more permissive and evidence-based than the policy that existed for decades prior to June 2016, when President Barack Obama’s defense secretary, Ashton Carter, abruptly unveiled a new policy. Before that, individuals who identified as transgender were automatically excluded from the military. Under the new policy devised by then-Defense Secretary James Mattis, the Pentagon makes a distinction between individuals who identify as transgender, and those who identify as transgender and experience gender dysphoria. It’s necessary to get a bit technical here. An individual who is transgender is a person whose gender identity does not correspond to that person’s biological sex. Transgender individuals who suffer from gender dysphoria often “experience significant distress and/or problems functioning associated with this conflict between the way they feel and think of themselves (referred to as experienced or expressed gender) and their physical or assigned gender.” Unlike the previous policy, the new rules allow individuals who are transgender but not experiencing gender dysphoria to join and serve in the military. Why does the policy prohibit service by individuals who experience gender dysphoria? It’s principally because exhaustive Defense Department clinical and U.S. survey data confirms that individuals with gender dysphoria attempt suicide at rates between eight and 10 times the average for individuals not suffering from gender dysphoria. Individuals with gender dysphoria experience severe anxiety again at between eight and nine times the rate of individuals without gender dysphoria. What’s more, there is no evidence that medical treatment, including gender-reassignment surgery, can remedy those challenges. Military service is inherently stressful. It takes service members and puts them in unfamiliar, lonely, austere, and often hostile areas. Stress, anxiety, and suicide are already existential military problems. Indeed, the suicide rate for active-duty military members has been slowly rising over the past couple of decades. At one point, it was lower than the U.S. national average. In 2015, however, in the active component, it stood at 20.2 per 100,000 service members, compared with the U.S. average of 13.3 per 100,000. It would, therefore, be reckless and ill-advised to allow individuals demonstrably at a higher risk of suicide and anxiety to join the military and be subject to the increased stresses of military duty—both for the readiness of their units and for the safety of the individual. Critics, in raising objections, ask why then can’t transgender individuals with gender dysphoria be allowed to serve far from the front lines, perhaps in a desk or office job? Surely, they say, that wouldn’t be stressful. But the military doesn’t work that way. In order for the military to be effective, to borrow an analogy, every player must be able to get on the field and play their position. If there were a job divorced from stress, it would be reasonable to ask why we would need a uniformed service member to fill it at all. Still others ask how such a tiny fraction of the military force that would be transgender, if allowed, could constitute a risk to a force the size of the U.S. military. That ignores the fact that the U.S. military often goes to war one squad, one plane, one ship at a time. Often, the performance of a single individual can mean the difference between mission success and failure. Finally, those opposed to the restrictions point to examples of transgender individuals who have successfully served in the military, including those who have been decorated for bravery. Kudos to these individuals for serving, and serving well. But the military must set entrance criteria based on broad evidence, as opposed to isolated examples. The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that individuals experiencing gender dysphoria, if allowed to enlist, would present unacceptable risks to both a prospective military unit and to themselves. Thus far, the courts have seen fit to substitute their judgment on military enlistment criteria in place of that of the commander in chief. That’s unfortunate. What would be even more unfortunate is if a decision were made to permit individuals with gender dysphoria to serve in the military, and in so doing, took a reckless gamble with both the readiness of the U.S. military and the safety of those patriotic individuals."},

Even though the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose the effects of these policies, politicians are blindly pushing further forward to expand their reach. That’s not equality. That’s madness. Yet House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., recently delivered on her promise to introduce the so-called “Equality Act,” which would elevate sexual orientation and gender identity to protected classes in federal anti-discrimination law. The Equality Act would definitely have a negative impact nationwide. Yet many Americans are already subject to sexual orientation and gender identity policies at the state and local level. Twenty-four states have passed sexual orientation and gender identity laws and the consequences for residents of those states have been disastrous. That includes laws that ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, public accommodations, housing, and education, as well as bans on counseling for individuals with unwanted same-sex attraction. Moreover, an estimated 400-plus cities and localities across all 50 stateshave adopted sexual orientation and gender identity policies by local ordinance. These policies are not being used to promote equality. Instead, they are being used as a blunt-force weapon to ban disagreement on marriage and sexuality by punishing dissenters. Colorado billionaire Tim Gill, the man dubbed “the megadonor behind the LGBTQ rights movement” by Rolling Stone, disclosed that his strategy is to implement sexual orientation and gender identity laws as quickly and widely as possible at the state level. He also disclosed his attitude towards supporters of traditional marriage. “We’re going into the hardest states in the country,” he said. “We’re going to punish the wicked.” That’s exactly how these laws have been used—not to protect people from unfair treatment, but to punish people for their beliefs. That’s true when it comes to debates over the meaning of marriage and the reality of biological sex. Americans from all walks of life who hold that marriage is a union between one man and one woman have been punished for their convictions. The most high-profile example is from Gill’s Colorado. Jack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, won at the Supreme Court after the Colorado Civil Rights Commission accused him of discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation under state law for refusing to bake a custom cake for a same-sex wedding ceremony. But Phillips is not the only one who has lost business and faced lawsuits for acting according to his beliefs about marriage. Other cases have arisen in Washington, New Mexico, Michigan, Minnesota, Colorado, Arizona, and Georgia, involving florists, photographers, wedding venue owners, videographers, web designers, calligraphers, and public servants. Meanwhile, faith-based foster care and adoption agencies in Pennsylvania,New York, Illinois, California, Massachusetts, and the District of Columbiahave been forced to shut down for operating according to their religious beliefs about marriage—further exacerbating our current foster care crisis. Now, cases are emerging involving Americans who have suffered consequences for holding that sex is a biological reality. Although the Supreme Court ruled in Phillips’ favor, the Colorado commission also investigated him for declining to create a “gender transition cake.” He sued and the commission settled. Catholic hospitals in New Jersey and California were sued for refusing to perform hysterectomies on otherwise healthy females who wanted to pursue gender transition. A third Catholic hospital in Washington settled after the ACLU sued it for declining to perform a double mastectomy and chest-reconstruction surgery on a 16-year-old girl. A teacher in Virginia was fired for failing to use a female student’s preferred masculine pronouns and a professor in Ohio was disciplined for doing the same. Female high school athletes in Connecticut lost the state championship to a pair of biologically male transgender women. A homeless shelter for abused women in Alaska has been sued for refusing to admit a biological male. In Michigan and Florida, women lost their memberships at Planet Fitness when they questioned sharing locker rooms with biological males under the gym’s transgender bathroom policy. Meanwhile, in Illinois, California, and Vermont, foster parents are expected to provide children suffering from gender dysphoria with transition-affirming therapies over parents’ medical or moral objections. That suggests that adherence to radical gender ideology could become a new litmus test for parental fitness. In fact, in Ohio, a judge removed a 17-year-old girl from her parents’ custody after they refused to sign their daughter up for testosterone treatments. The judge did so even without a state sexual orientation and gender identity policy. If a federal sexual orientation and gender identity policy were to politicize medicine across the country, parental rights could be at stake here, too. It’s worth noting that all of this has happened without a federal sexual orientation and gender identity policy. The federal Equality Act would only make this bad situation worse. The bill would pose an existential threat not only to religious organizations from churches to schools to charities, but also to secular institutions as well—not to mention the livelihoods of individuals who do not agree with new sexual norms or gender ideology. That’s why a federal sexual orientation and gender identity law with religious exemptions is still bad policy. That strategy only protects the interests of a few and imposes a bad law on everyone else. The weaponization of sexual orientation and gender identity laws at the state and local level have made it eminently clear that a federal law would have devastating effects on the American people. Lawmakers ought to oppose any kind of federal sexual orientation and gender identity anti-discrimination law."},

That all changed when she was sexually assaulted. The worst part? School policy protected the assailant instead of the victim. Now politicians are hoping to replicate this policy nationwide. It all began when Thomas's daughter asked her teacher for permission to use the restroom. Shortly thereafter, a boy in the class also asked if he could use the restroom. The girl was exiting a stall when, to her surprise, her male classmate confronted her. He pushed her against the wall and, despite her protestations, forcibly touched her genitals. When Thomas's daughter told her mother what had happened, she did what any mother would do: She stood up for her child and demanded that the school take measures to ensure the boy who had attacked her daughter would not do so again. But the school claimed it couldn't help. Its anti-discrimination policy grants students access to the facilities of their choice based on self-identified gender. The boy in question identified as \"gender fluid.\" Therefore, he could continue to use the girls' restroom whenever he wanted. Without the privacy and safety of a female-only restroom, the school was no longer a safe space for Thomas's daughter. She removed the girl from school and has since filed a complaint with the Department of Education. State and local sexual orientation gender identity policies are a Trojan horse. They claim to promote equality but have been used to allow males into women's sports and spaces, attack businesses and charities, and politicize medicine.

{"title": "7 Reasons Why the Equality Act Is Anything But", "author": ["Monica  Burke"], "date": "Mar 14, 2019 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/7-reasons-why-the-equality-act-anything", "takeaways": [], "text": "Most Americans don’t want a nationwide bathroom requirement, health care mandate, or “preferred pronoun” law based on gender identity, but congressional Democrats seem to think it’s time to impose them. Nancy Pelosi delivered Wednesday on her promise to introduce the so-called Equality Act, which would elevate sexual orientation and gender identity to protected classes in federal anti-discrimination law. Although that may sound nice in theory, in practice sexual orientation and gender identity policies at the state and local level have caused profound harms to Americans from all walks of life. How might a sexual orientation and gender identity law on the federal level, as introduced in the House and Senate, affect you and your community? Here are seven ways: 1. It would penalize Americans who don’t affirm new sexual norms or gender ideology. Jack Phillips’ case went all the way to the Supreme Court after the Colorado Civil Rights Commission accused the bakery owner of discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation when the self-described cake artist declined to create a custom cake to celebrate a same-sex wedding. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, but left the law in question, the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, intact. Until last week, Phillips was in court again defending himself against the same agency under the same law. The day after the Supreme Court ruled in Phillips’ case, Autumn Scardina, a lawyer who identifies as transgender, requested that he create a “gender transition cake.” After Phillips declined, the state Civil Rights Commission found probable cause under the law that the baker had discriminated on the basis of gender identity. Thankfully, the commission last week dropped the case, and Phillips agreed to drop his own lawsuit accusing the state agency of harassing him for his Christian beliefs. Phillips is just one of many Americans who have lost income because of their belief that marriage is between one man and one woman. Others cases involve florists, bakers, photographers, wedding venue owners, videographers, web designers, calligraphers, and public servants. These cases are just the beginning. The same policies used to silence disagreement over marriage can be used to silence disagreement over the biological reality of sex. 2. It would compel speech. Virginia high school teacher Peter Vlaming lost his job for something he did not say. A county school board voted unanimously to fire the veteran teacher over the objections of his students after he refused to comply with administrators’ orders to use masculine pronouns in referring to a female student who identifies as transgender. Vlaming did his best to accommodate the student without violating his religious belief that God created human beings male and female, using the student’s new name and simply refraining from using pronouns altogether. Unfortunately, the school still considered this a violation of its anti-discrimination policy. Incidents like these would increase under federal policy proposed in the Equality Act. Both federal and private employers could face costly lawsuits if they fail to implement strict preferred pronoun policies. Employees could be disciplined if they fail to comply, regardless of their scientific or moral objections. 3. It could shut down charities. Foster care and adoption agencies, drug rehabilitation centers, and homeless centers already face challenges under state and local policies on sexual orientation and gender identity. In Philadelphia, just days after the city put out an urgent call for 300 additional families to foster children, the city halted child placements by Catholic Social Services because of the organization’s belief that every child deserves both a mother and a father. Although same-sex couples have the opportunity to foster children through the state or every other agency in Philadelphia, the city canceled its contract with Catholic Social Services. The agency’s approved foster homes remain available while children languish on the waiting list. A federal sexual orientation and gender identity law would make this situation a national phenomenon, which would spell disaster for the 437,500 children in foster care nationwide. Other charities would be affected, too. In Anchorage, Alaska, a biological male born Timothy Paul Coyle goes by the name of Samantha Amanda Coyle. On two occasions, Coyle tried to gain access to the city’s Downtown Soup Kitchen Hope Center, a shelter for homeless, abused, and trafficked women. In one attempt, authorities said, Coyle was inebriated and had gotten into a fight with a staffer at another shelter, so Hope Center staff paid Coyle’s fare to the emergency room to receive medical attention. Coyle sued the center for “gender identity discrimination.” A federal sexual orientation and gender identity law could force any social service organization to open up private facilities—including single-sex bathrooms, showers, and sleeping areas—to members of the opposite sex. 4. It would allow more biological males to defeat girls in sports. Two biological males who identify and compete as women easily defeated all of their female competitors in an event at the Connecticut State Track Championships. Transgender athlete Terry Miller broke the state record in the girls’100-meter dash. Andraya Yearwood, also transgender, took second place. Selina Soule, a female runner, not only lost to the biological males in the championships but also lost out on valuable opportunities to be seen by college coaches and chosen for scholarships. Soule said about the 100-meter event: “We all know the outcome of the race before it even starts; it’s demoralizing.” A federal sexual orientation and gender identity law would defeat the purpose of Title IX of the Civil Rights Act, which is supposed to guarantee women equal educational and athletic opportunities. Under radical gender identity policies, female athletes have sustained gruesome injuries at the hands of male competitors. In high school wrestling, female athletes have forfeited rather than compete against transgender athletes on testosterone. A federal law could set girls’ and women’s sports back permanently at every level. 5. It could be used to coerce medical professionals. Under state sexual orientation and gender identity laws, individuals who identify as transgender have sued Catholic hospitals in California and New Jersey for declining to perform hysterectomies on otherwise healthy women who wanted to pursue gender transition. If these lawsuits succeed, medical professionals would be pressured to treat patients according to ideology rather than their best medical judgment. The Obama administration tried to coerce medical professionals into offering transition-affirming therapies through a regulation in the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. That move was stopped in the 11th hour by a federal judge. However, that could all be set back in motion if a national law imposes a nationwide health care mandate regarding gender identity. 6. It could lead to more parents losing custody of their children. The politicization of medicine according to gender ideology will create more conflicts among parents, doctors, and the government. A federal sexual orientation and gender identity law would jeopardize parental rights nationwide. In fact, the current issue of the American Journal of Bioethics includes an article arguing that the state should overrule the parents of transgender children who do not consent to give them puberty-blocking drugs. This has already happened. In Ohio, a judge removed a biological girl from her parents’ custody after they declined to help her “transition” to male with testosterone supplements. After the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital’s Transgender Health Clinic recommended these treatments for the girl’s gender dysphoria, the parents wanted to pursue counseling instead. Then the county’s family services agency charged the parents with abuse and neglect, and the judge terminated their custody. Similar cases are proceeding through the courts with children as young as6 years old. Meanwhile, studies show that 80 to 95 percent of children no longer experience gender dysphoria after puberty. Politicizing medicine could have serious consequences for children who are exposed to the unnecessary medical risks of drastic therapies. A federal sexual orientation and gender identity law would make these cases more common. 7. It would enable sexual assault. A complaint under investigation by federal education officials alleges that a boy who identifies as “gender fluid” at Oakhurst Elementary School in Decatur, Georgia, sexually assaulted Pascha Thomas’ 5-year-old daughter in a girls’ restroom. The boy had access to the girls’ restroom because of Decatur City Schools’ transgender restroom policy. School authorities refused to change the policy even after Thomas reported the assault. Eventually, she decided to remove her daughter from school for the girl’s emotional well-being and physical safety. A federal sexual orientation and gender identity law would give male sexual predators who self-identify as females access to private facilities, increasing the likelihood of these tragic incidents. It could also make victims less likely to report sexual misconduct and police less likely to get involved, for fear of being accused of discrimination. The proposed Equality Act could impose a nationwide bathroom policy that would leave women and children in particular vulnerable to predators. It actually would promote inequality by elevating the ideologies of special-interest groups to the level of protected groups in civil rights law. *** The Equality Act defies the purpose of anti-discrimination laws. The original Civil Rights Act was enacted to protect African-Americans from being denied access to material goods and services. The Equality Act, by contrast, would be used as a sword to attack people and force them to adopt new ideologies about human sexuality. This extreme and dangerous legislation would create unprecedented harms to businesses, charities, medical professionals, women and children, and entire families. The writing is on the wall: The Equality Act is anything but."},

Anderson, Ph.D."], "date": "Dec 17, 2018 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/misguided-proposal-christian-leaders-and-lgbt-activists-anything-fairness-all", "takeaways": [], "text": "Does the golden rule ever require bad public policy? That’s the implication of what some political strategists are proposing in the name of fairness. At issue is a proposal among some Christian leaders to strike a compromise with some LGBT activists to balance “LGBT rights” with religious liberty. The proposal would elevate “sexual orientation and gender identity” (SOGI) to protected classes in federal law in exchange for certain exemptions for religious colleges and institutions. They call this approach “Fairness for All.” Compromises can be good, but this particular one is bad. As I explain in a recent issue brief, such proposals would not result in actual fairness for all.Instead, they would penalize many Americans who believe that we are created male and female, and that male and female are created for each other. They would violate the privacy and safety of women and girls, the conscience rights of doctors and other medical professionals, and the free speech and religious liberty rights of countless professionals who find themselves outside the select group of institutions who are exempted. Establishing bad public policy for everyone and then exempting select religious institutions is not acting for the common good—and is certainly not fair for all. And there are better ways forward for those who seek compromise. Yet some are now claiming that this bad public policy is required by the golden rule. Rod Dreher reports on a conversation he had with “a prominent conservative Evangelical political strategist” who requested to remain anonymous. Dreher writes: “He simply believes that ethically and politically, this is the right thing to do. In Smith’s view, in a pluralistic society like America 2018, do unto others as you would have them do unto you is a good rule for religious liberty advocates and gay rights supporters alike.” The golden rule is always a good rule for all people. But the public policy being proposed doesn’t embody the golden rule. Making “gender identity” a protected class in federal policy, for example, could impose a nationwide transgender bathroom policy, a nationwide pronoun policy, and a nationwide sex-reassignment health care mandate. This is anything but the golden rule. And imposing bad law on everyone else while exempting yourself is the exact opposite of doing unto others as you would have them do unto you. The anonymous political insider Dreher talked with also seems confused about pluralism: It’s rather remarkable to think that accommodating deep difference requires passing laws that impose orthodoxy. But that’s what SOGI laws do, including Fairness for All. Dreher summarizes the anonymous insider’s perspective: “He said there really is a question of justice within a pluralistic society that conservative Christians have to face. We may sincerely believe that homosexuality is morally wrong, but at what point does the common good require that we agree that gay people have a right to be wrong?” But that’s not what this policy debate is about. In the United States of America, people who identify as LGBT are free to live as they want. But SOGI laws, including Fairness for All, are not about freedom—they are about coercion. SOGI and Fairness for All are about forcing all Americans to embrace—and live out—certain beliefs about human sexuality. They are not about protecting the freedom of people to live as LGBT, but about coercing everyone else to support, facilitate, and endorse such actions. This is one fundamental problem in equating coercive antidiscrimination laws with permissive religious freedom laws. And imposing a bad coercive policy on everyone while exempting select faith-based institutions is anything but fairness for all. Antidiscrimination laws are about the government coercing people to live according to the majority’s values. Religious liberty laws are about removing government coercion and allowing people to live by their own beliefs. While there can be good justifications for certain antidiscrimination policies, there is no human right to them. Religious freedom, however, is a human right. Fairness for All mistakenly conflates these rather different concepts. And yet, the president of a Christian college—who also sits on the board of two Christian organizations who recently voted to support Fairness for All—claimsthat these coercive policies that undermine the common good are actually “basic human rights for members of the LGBT community.” But coercing other people into supporting LGBT values is not a “basic human right.” Nor is religious liberty the only value at stake. And yet, the anonymous political strategist says: “The so-called Fairness for All project has always been about how do we protect the most religious liberty that we can in a realistic way.” But as any number of policy analysts have pointed out, the problem with SOGI laws goes well beyond “religious liberty.” And exempting your own institutions while imposing these bad policies on everyone else doesn’t address the problems. How do religious exemptions help women in secular institutions who don’t want men in their bathrooms? How do religious exemptions help secular doctors who think it a misdirection of medicine to perform a double mastectomy on a woman who wants to identify as a man? All of the misguided rhetoric suggests that the underlying policy of elevating sexual orientation and gender identity to protected classes is misguided from the start. None of this, however, is to say that we shouldn’t work to find compromises and win-win solutions. I’ve been participating in these discussions for several years now, and contributed a chapter to a forthcoming Cambridge University Press book, “Religious Freedom, LGBT Rights, and the Prospects for Common Ground,” proposing how to properly craft policy that would be fair for all. The title of the book is misguided, both because there are no such things as “LGBT rights”—human rights are equally possessed by everyone, but there are no special human rights based on one’s sexual identity—and because it frames the discussion as one primarily about religious liberty. As I explain in my chapter (and this National Affairs essay), a better policy approach would be to better define the specific needs of people who identify as LGBT that actually require a policy solution, tailor a policy response to that need, and properly define what constitutes “discrimination.” Indeed, properly defining “discrimination” is key. Part of the problem with SOGI policies, including Freedom for All, is that they leave it entirely at the whim of hostile bureaucrats and judges to declare that commonsense actions may constitute “discrimination.” SOGI laws treat reasonable actions as discriminatory. A better approach would define specifically what constitutes “discrimination,” as distinct from genuine difference in a pluralistic society, and target a legal response at that. Does anyone even really know what elevating gender identity to a protected class in civil rights law will mean long term? What does “discrimination” on the basis of “gender identity” entail? Activists currently claim that combating “discrimination” requires new bathroom, pronoun, and health care policies. But when you consider the fact that most Americans hadn’t even heard the phrase “gender identity” five years ago, it seems premature to suggest that elevating it to a protected class status is a “basic human right” and a requirement of the golden rule. Now is not the time to rush to conclusions, but to think critically and prudently. In the midst of the redefinitions of marriage, sex, and gender, all Americans—wherever they fall on the political spectrum and whether they are religious, secular, or agnostic—should join the effort to find ways to coexist peacefully. SOGI laws, including Freedom for All, do not achieve this goal. Instead, they penalize disagreement as if it were discrimination, impose sexual orthodoxy, and coerce dissenters. SOGI antidiscrimination laws are unjustified, but if other policies are adopted to address the needs of people who identify as LGBT that require a policy response, they must leave people free to engage in legitimate actions based on the conviction that we are created male and female, and that male and female are created for each other. Any such laws must protect the privacy and safety of women and girls, the conscience rights of doctors and other medical professionals, and the free speech and religious liberty rights of countless professionals. This would leave all Americans free to act on those convictions. It would also protect diversity and promote tolerance, and it would promote true fairness for all."},

Yet that’s exactly what is happening increasingly across the country and around the world, as a growing number of male athletes who self-identify as women are being allowed to enter women’s competitions. The so-called Equality Act would only worsen this trend. This piece of federal legislation, being pushed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., would create a civil right for male athletes to self-identify as females at any time, without any evidence of physical changes to their bodies. It would spell “the end of women’s sports,” in the words of Duke University Law School professor Doriane Lambelet Coleman, who testified against the bill at a recent House Judiciary Committee hearing. But at that hearing, Sunu Chandy of the National Women’s Law Center trivialized these concerns. She stated, “We do not create policy about myths and stereotypes … There’s no research to support the claim that allowing trans athletes to play on teams that fit their gender identity will create a competitive imbalance.” Yet such evidence does exist. There is plenty of empirical evidence showing that replacing “sex” with “gender identity” as a criterion for entry into athletic competition would eliminate opportunities for the athletic abilities of large numbers of women to be properly recognized. In the case of Mack Beggs, a female wrestler who identifies as male, she was allowed to take testosterone. That led three of her female competitors to forfeit the competition out of fear of being injured. As Coleman testified in the hearing, “So overwhelming is the advantage of testosterone that thousands of men and boys could defeat the female Olympic gold medalists in the 400 meters.” She also wrote in The New York Times, “It doesn’t matter that there are 100 females and three males in a girls’ race if the three males win spots in the final or on the podium because they are males.” Everyone has the right to compete in sports, but creating a right to compete on the basis of gender identity won’t simply add a right. It will eliminate the right of women and girls to compete against members of their own sex. In 1972, Congress passed Title IX of the 1972 Educational Amendments to the Civil Rights Act, which ordered schools to create separate athletic teams for women. Congress didn’t simply tell schools to let women compete for spots on men’s teams. That would have been self-defeating, as only a few exceptional female athletes would win spots due to men’s greater physical power, strength, and speed. Yet despite ample scientific evidence of males’ physical advantages over females, supporters of the Equality Act like Yale University School of Law professor Kenji Yoshino insist that “trans women have not broadly displaced or disadvantaged non-trans women or girls when allowed to compete in accordance with their gender.” But even without the Equality Act, women and girls are losing titles, medals, and scholarship opportunities in states where gender identity has already replaced sex. H.R. 5 would dramatically accelerate and expand these adverse impacts on females by requiring athletic programs to recognize gender identity as a protected class in order to receive federal funding. Here are 10 examples of male athletes identifying as women in female sports. Under the Equality Act, we could only expect more of this. In the last example, 16-year-old Selina Soule described the race as “demoralizing” because, when male athletes enter women and girls races, everyone knows who will win before the race begins. Even worse, her chances of being seen by college scouts disappeared when Yearwood and Miller took top spots at the state championships. Soule said she chose to speak out so that no other girl athlete would face the same disappointment. Hopefully, Congress will listen to voices like hers before it’s too late."},

Here’s Where She Went Wrong.", "author": ["Monica  Burke"], "date": "Oct 11, 2018 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/marriage-and-family/commentary/taylor-swift-finally-went-political-heres-where-she-went-wrong", "takeaways": [], "text": "Taylor Swift made waves this week when she made the first political statement of her career. The country-turned-pop star has famously kept silent on politics over the years, but everything changed as of Monday, when she posted an endorsement of two Democratic candidates for office on her Instagram account. Swift’s post perpetuates misconceptions about the belief in traditional marriage and a principled objection to sexual orientation and gender identity laws. She wrote: The specifics of this election cycle aside, Swift’s position gravely misunderstands the values held by many Tennessee voters, and indeed, citizens across the country. Swift asserts that she “cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender, or who they love.” According to Swift, a belief in traditional marriage or opposition to adding sexual orientation and gender identity to anti-discrimination law constitutes an attack on the dignity of LGBT people. Swift falsely assumes that certain mainstream beliefs—the belief that marriage is between one man and one woman, or opposition to sexual orientation and gender identity laws—necessarily stems from animosity toward LGBT people. That could not be further from the truth. This misconception overlooks the fact that social conservatives may identify as LGBT themselves, and many social conservatives count LGBT individuals among their family, colleagues, and friends. A difference of opinion about the meaning of marriage does not constitute bigotry or discrimination. The belief that marriage is between one man and one woman because the sexes are complementary, and because children deserve a mother and a father, is not hateful toward anyone. As Justice Anthony Kennedy observed in Obergefell v. Hodges, many Americans hold this belief “based on decent and honorable premises.” This explains why the Supreme Court ruled the way it did in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, the case involving the Christian baker who declined to create a custom cake for a same-sex wedding. The court declared that “religious and philosophical objections to gay marriage are protected views and in some instances protected forms of expression.” Kennedy noted in oral arguments that, in refusing to bake a cake for a same-sex wedding celebration, the baker had not discriminated on the basis of the couple’s identity. At stake was a principled disagreement about actions related to the meaning of marriage, or as Kennedy put it, “what they’re doing.” Swift’s mention of refusal of service raises the issue of anti-discrimination laws, like the Colorado law in Masterpiece that included sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes. The problem with these laws is that they ultimately fail to achieve the desired goal of nondiscrimination in a way that respects the constitutional rights of those who dissent from dominant views or certain lifestyle choices. For one, sexual orientation and gender identity are, by their very definitions, fluid and subjective. This sets them apart from race and biological sex, which are fixed. Hence, sexual orientation and gender identity make a poor legal standard and result in poor legal outcomes. Quite often, anti-discrimination laws on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity are not used for their intended purpose—to protect people from discrimination—but instead to attack people. As countless Americans continue to uphold a traditional view of marriage, state and local officials have accused citizens in a wide variety of professions of discrimination for speaking and acting in accordance with their beliefs. Bakers, florists, photographers, videographers, calligraphers, graphic designers—the list goes on and on. None of these cases involved a blanket denial of service to LGBT people. As Andrew Koppelman, an LGBT advocate, observed, “There have been no claims of a right to simply refuse to deal with gay people.” Instead, all of these cases have involved the government forcing citizens to communicate a message that violates their beliefs about marriage. Unfortunately, it appears that these conflicts are frequently the result of anti-religious animus, which may be part and parcel with the passage of such anti-discrimination laws. Tim Gill, the man dubbed “the megadonor behind the LGBTQ rights movement” by Rolling Stone, revealed to the magazine his strategy in funding the push to add sexual orientation and gender identity to anti-discrimination laws: “We’re going to punish the wicked.” This anti-religious justification for sexual orientation and gender identity laws suggests that the penalties imposed upon citizens have more to do with anti-religious sentiment than a desire to protect LGBT people from genuine harm. But Swift does get something very important right. She is fundamentally correct in that we ought to place a premium on the dignity of every human being, and that we have a responsibility to protect human dignity through political institutions and the exercise of our constitutional rights and liberties. A healthy understanding of human dignity should lead us all to treat others with respect and compassion, even when our beliefs conflict. However, true tolerance cuts both ways. That means that we must remain free to disagree on the meaning of marriage—and not treat that disagreement as an attack on the dignity of LGBT people. How do we achieve this? Existing sexual orientation and gender identity policies should be narrowly interpreted to act as shields against truly discriminatory practices, not as swords to punish religious beliefs. In places without such policies, we should instead pursue a civil society and a culture that treats LGBT individuals with respect and simultaneously respects those who uphold a traditional view of marriage. Approaching LGBT issues with compassion does not preclude one from holding principled opposition to the policies Swift alludes to. Swift, like many of us, wants to protect the right to live and speak according to one’s beliefs. For that right to truly extend both ways, Americans must be free to disagree about marriage. I’m writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I’ll be voting in the state of Tennessee. In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent. I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway. So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to do. October 9th is the LAST DAY to register to vote in the state of TN. Go to vote.org and you can find all the info. Happy Voting! ???

", "Americans must work together to protect our children from this destructive agenda. "], "text": "Recently, I heard from a woman who has a teenage daughter four years into the process of transitioning. Throughout that time, this mom has been trying to get left-leaning media and think tanks and professional associations to take seriously the concerns coming from the left. Instead she’s found herself and her colleagues essentially left behind by the left. But her situation is hardly unique in today’s America. Just last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report showing that 2 percent of American high school students now identify as transgender. That’s a population-wide statistic. The percentage is even higher in particular communities and schools. Girls are affected the most. In many western countries this has become an epidemic. Recently, the U.K. ordered an investigation into why the number of young girls seeking treatment at gender clinics increased by 4,000 percent. Something is going on. Too many of these young people feel unsafe, attacked, and they commit self-harm. We need to find better ways to support them without damaging their bodies for life. And so this mom, who wants to remain anonymous, wanted to know if The Heritage Foundation could host a conversation featuring liberals with concerns about the left’s embrace of the transgender agenda. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is currently pushing the Equality Act, which would have legal ramifications for those who don’t agree with the transgender agenda. We were willing—and we did. On Monday, I hosted at Heritage an event titled “The Inequality of the Equality Act: Concerns from the Left.” Heritage’s founder, Ed Feulner, is famous for saying that it’s better to add and multiply than to divide and subtract. Undoubtedly, the people on this panel disagree about many things. I likely disagree with them about abortion, gay marriage, taxes, trade, foreign policy—just to name a few. And that’s OK. Just because we disagree about some things, even many things, that doesn’t mean we disagree about everything. And where we do agree, we can—and should—work together. Because make no mistake: The current LGBT agenda is poised to affect everyone on both the left and right. “Gender identity” refers to an individual’s inner sense of being a man or a woman or both or neither. It exists along a spectrum and can be fluid. It’s entirely arbitrary and self-disclosed. And rather incoherent, as it’s not at all clear what it means to “feel like” a woman, or how I would know if I felt like one, or why my feeling like a woman (whatever that means) would make me a woman. As a result, if “gender identity” becomes a protected class in federal civil rights law, as Pelosi’s Equality Act would result in, there will be serious negative consequences. That’s where we agree. And that’s where we can work together. As I spoke with that anonymous mother about the possibility of a public event, several things became clear. First, the media wants to present the transgender cause as the next wave of civil rights and as the natural extension of the past decade of LGBT successes. If you support what the media calls gay rights, you have to support trans rights. If you support what the media calls marriage equality, you have to support trans equality. There’s little willingness to recognize that the LGB and the T are radically dissimilar, especially as applied to children. Second, the media wants to present this issue as one of science vs. faith. That there’s a consensus among doctors that people are born trans, that children as young as 2 or 3 can know their “true” gender identity, and that social transitioning and sex reassignment procedures—now referred to as “gender affirmation” or “gender confirmation”—are safe and effective treatment protocols. And that the only people who could think otherwise must be acting based on bigotry and blind faith. Third, the media wants to ignore all of the costs. They don’t care about the damage being done to young people’s bodies and minds—in fact, they celebrate it as a civil right. They don’t care about the privacy and safety and equality of girls, when boys who identify as girls can share female-only spaces—like showers and locker rooms and bathrooms—and when boys who identify as girls win female athletic competitions. They don’t care about the ability of doctors to practice good medicine, when bad medicine becomes mandated as a civil right, and good medicine becomes outlawed as a civil wrong. And they don’t care about the rights of parents to find the best care for their kids. Sadly, some religious people give support to these narratives, when they agree to support “gender identity” laws, provided they get a religious exemption. But bad public policy doesn’t become good by exemptions for oneself that do nothing for the privacy, safety, equality, and liberty of others. “Gender identity” ideology will impact everyone. Right and left. Conservative and liberal. Religious and secular."},

United States, added, “[t]he two sexes are not fungible.\""], "text": "Growing up with only sisters as siblings, we were raised to aspire to all that we were capable of—no “ifs,” “ands,” or “buts.” So, while Ruth Bader Ginsburg may not be my favorite Supreme Court justice in terms of her jurisprudence, I deeply admire how she proved that she is just as capable as any man to sit on the highest bench in the nation. That’s why I was so excited to watch the new biopic “On the Basis of Sex,” which dramatizes Ginsburg’s early career and her battle to overcome sex discrimination, not only in her own life, but also in the law. What struck me about the movie is what it didn’t do—reinterpret the word “sex” in “sex discrimination” to mean “gender identity.” In the movie, after Ginsburg has finished writing her legal brief in Moritz v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, arguing that a bachelor who was denied a tax deduction for his mother’s caretaker was discriminated against for being a man, one of her students at Rutgers University must copy the final draft on a typewriter. As the student presents the final copy to Ginsburg, she timidly mentions that, after typing up the brief page by page, one word was practically jumping off the page: “sex.” Ginsburg agrees that the provocative connotation of the word might be too distracting and suggests swapping it for the word “gender.” From there on out, all of the characters substitute the term “gender” for “sex.” That makes sense when you consider the historical development of the term “gender,” which arose in the 1960s as a contradistinction from sex, to indicate the social expectations traditionally associated with one of the sexes. I was not surprised at all by Ginsburg’s student’s observation about the legal brief. Of course, sex was practically jumping off the page of the initial brief—because the way we determine the sex of any sexually dimorphic species, humans included, is by observing overall organization toward reproduction. “On the Basis of Sex” confirmed this scientific reality. Later in the film, Ginsburg is practicing defending her client in a moot court. In this fictional encounter, one of the judges is Pauli Murray, an African-American lawyer and women’s rights activist, who some have speculated would have identified as transgender today. Even if Murray’s inclusion in the film was intended to suggest that gender identity is the “new frontier” of equality, the dialogue attests to the biological nature of sex. In the midst of the heated questioning, Ginsburg is asked to explain whether sex discrimination is similar to racial discrimination. In response, Ginsburg points out that sex, like race, is a biological, immutable trait. She’s right. The real Ginsburg made this point in her majority opinion in United States v. Virginia, which ordered Virginia Military Institute, the state’s all-male military school, to become coed. There, she wrote that “[p]hysical differences between men and women … are enduring,” and, quoting Ballard v. United States, added, “[t]he two sexes are not fungible.” The film is also right about sex discrimination. Historically speaking, women were denied many of the same opportunities as men because of harmful stereotypes about men and women. Stereotypes, such as that men are better at math or that women are too emotional to practice law, directly undermine equality between the sexes—and women are most often the ones who lose out. The film does a great job capturing the subtle ways that sex discrimination can manifest itself, from Ginsburg’s differential treatment at Harvard Law School to the belittling comments of her husband Martin’s boss. The film really captures how much has changed for women over the years, as Ginsburg tells the judges in the Moritz trial that 100 years ago, she would not have been allowed to even stand before them. The historical reality of sex discrimination and the ontological reality of sex as a biological and unchangeable trait is exactly why it would be wrong to reinterpret “sex” in anti-discrimination law. Unfortunately, that’s not preventing state agencies, activists, and litigatorsfrom making the argument that sex can mean “gender identity,” a term that by its very definition is fluid and subjective. Reinterpreting “sex” to mean “gender identity” would be a mistake from both a legal and policy perspective. Legally speaking, for our law to remain intelligible, we cannot reinterpret the law at will to achieve new political ends. No one thought to call into question the meaning of the word “sex” in anti-discrimination law except within the past few years, which suggests that—to borrow a metaphor from the film—this so-called new sense of the term is a change corresponding to the weather of the day, not the climate of the culture. From a policy standpoint, we ought to take serious pause before implementing sweeping policies that have serious implications for women and girls—whether by reinterpreting sex or adding “gender identity” to anti-discrimination law, as proposed by the so-called Equality Act. When women are forced to share sex-specific spaces with biological males, this makes women less likely to report sexual assault and law enforcement less likely to get involved for fear of being charged with discrimination. Women—and men—are also entitled to privacy from the opposite biological sex. In United States v. Virginia, Ginsburg wrote that the Virginia Military Institute “would undoubtedly require alterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in living arrangements.” Any policy that claims to create equality for all must take these concerns seriously. So, what is the verdict on the movie? I found it to be an enjoyable film that reminds us that men and women are more than mere stereotypes—and that women are equally human, and therefore equally qualified to do great things. I am extremely grateful to those who went before me and fought for my right to vote, to receive an education, and to do meaningful work—and that includes Ginsburg. Judicial differences aside, I think she is a great example of what women are capable of—and “On the Basis of Sex” did a great job of capturing that."},

Google conducts such an audit every year, and this year produced a surprising result. According to The New York Times, Google’s analysis found that more men than women were being underpaid. As a result, Google will award $9.7 million out of a compensation fund, the majority of it going to men. The fund was established to remedy compensation gaps revealed by the annual study. The study’s results conflict sharply with analysis conducted by the Labor Department, which is currently investigating the tech giant. Janet Herold, regional solicitor for the Labor Department, said her department’s analysis at this point indicates discrimination against women, and that this discrimination is “quite extreme.” The Labor Department is also suing Google to force it to hand over data that Google believes reveals confidential information and violated employees’ privacy. Google is also facing an employee-led effort that claims the company significantly underpays women compared to men. So who’s right? Google, its employees, or the government? Well, it depends on how you measure pay between groups. Across the U.S., broad-based pay comparisons show that women make 20 cents less on the dollar than men. But after accounting for important factors such as one’s education, hours spent at work, occupation, and experience, the gap drops to between 3 and 5 cents. And even that doesn’t account for harder-to-measure factors. The government has little insight into the day-to-day operations of Google and has to rely on limited and abstract data, such as job title, pay, gender, and race. This means government reports are less likely to paint an accurate picture of employee pay according to work performed. And how about the employee-led effort? It only included self-reported pay data from 2 percent of Google’s global workforce and was divided across six broad pay levels. Clearly, the government’s analysis, as well as the employee-led effort, are lacking. They essentially assume that all employees with the same job title perform identical jobs, when in fact that is not the case. Google is not a 1950 assembly line where all employees clock in at 9 a.m., produce 50 widgets, and then clock out at 5 p.m. It is a diverse and complex company in which job titles may say little about the work an employee does. While the government and employee-led studies are limited, Google itself performed a more detailed analysis. After all, the company knows a thing or two about analyzing data. Google presumably included important factors in its analysis that affect pay, such as years of experience, education, hours, and some measure of performance. Even so, this did not create a true apples-to-apples comparison. Nor could it. In today’s day and age, with more flexible job schedules, highly diversified job functions (even within a given title), and broad compensation packages, very few jobs are truly identical. The problem with top-down government controls that attempt to equalize pay across gender or race is that those policies could end up hurting the people they intend to help. For starters, policies like the Paycheck Fairness Act threaten to take away decades of gains women have made in the labor market by eliminating more flexible arrangements, and instead imposing one-size-fits-all jobs, schedules, and compensation packages that may not actually fit women’s needs and desires. Moreover, expensive lawsuits encouraged by such legislation would likely cause employers to discriminate against women in the hiring process—thus protecting themselves against potential gender-based discrimination lawsuits. At the end of the day, most workers—men and women alike—want to be paid based on what they produce. That’s not possible with government-imposed pay scales. Instead of telling companies how much to pay their workers, and limiting the types of jobs available to women (and men), lawmakers should work to reduce barriers and burdens for job creators and support women in the choices they make for themselves."},
{"title": "Democrats Want to Close the \"Gender Pay Gap.\" Here Are 4 Ways Their Proposal Would Backfire.", "author": ["Rachel  Greszler"], "date": "Jan 31, 2019 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/jobs-and-labor/commentary/democrats-want-close-the-gender-pay-gap-here-are-4-ways-their-proposal", "takeaways": [], "text": "If a woman performs the same job as a man, she should receive the same pay. That’s common sense. The same goes for people with white skin and brown skin, or red hair or blonde hair, or green eyes, and so on. Pay should be based on one thing alone: the work performed. Period. This is exactly what happens in a well-functioning market, because employers who engage in pay discrimination will end up losing their underpaid workers to other companies, resulting in their own loss of productivity and profits. Nevertheless, raw statistics show that the average woman makes about 80 cents on the dollar compared to the average man. That’s enough for many on the left to cry foul. What they miss, however, is that discrimination doesn’t account for most of that difference. All but about 5 to 7 cents of the so-called gender pay gap can be explained by differences such as education, choice of occupation, and hours spent at work. The remaining few cents can be explained, at least in part, by unmeasured factors like forgoing higher pay for more flexible work schedules and higher benefit packages. There is already clear evidence that anti-pay gap policies will not change these factors. A recent economic study from Harvard University looked at workers who performed the exact same job in a unionized environment that had rigid pay scales prohibiting gender-based pay discrimination. The study still found an 11-cent pay gap. That gap was due entirely to women choosing to work fewer overtime hours than men and choosing to take more unpaid leave. But some policymakers don’t seem to care as much about the choices women and men make. Instead, they just want to force equal outcomes regardless of choice. Their latest effort is a bill called the Paycheck Fairness Act. A Completely Unnecessary Bill Both Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Equal Pay Act of 1963 already prohibit sex discrimination in the workplace. The Paycheck Fairness Act would go beyond that and make virtually any difference in pay between a male and female employee—including those justified by factors like education, experience, and hours of work—grounds for a lawsuit. And you’d better believe the lawsuits will increase. The bill would impose new pay-reporting requirements for federal contractors and would allow the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to collect and analyze private companies’ pay data—a field day for trial attorneys. The bill would also remove the current $300,000 limit on compensatory and punitive damages, and would automatically include workers in class-action lawsuits unless they proactively opt-out. All of this would turn gender-based discrimination lawsuits into “jackpot justice” for eager lawyers. Proponents of this bill say they’re fighting for fairness and for the welfare of women, yet the bill would have stark consequences for women, as well as men, businesses, and the economy as a whole. Here are four of the bill’s most negative consequences: 1. One-size-fits-all jobs. It’s a proven fact that women, overall, value flexibility in their jobs much more than men, and men value higher pay more than women. This means men and women choose different work arrangements that fit their respective desires. Women are more likely to seek out flexible schedules, remote work options, and unscheduled leave, which can benefit workers and employers alike—and they are often willing to accept lower pay in exchange for more flexible or alternative work arrangements. Men do this too, just at a lesser rate. The Paycheck Fairness Act would take those flexible options away. By threatening employers with costly lawsuits, it would force employers to offer one-size-fits-all jobs that don’t meet the needs and desires of many workers, especially those of women. 2. Lower overall wages. When you mandate equality in wages, it’s likely you’ll achieve that equality not by lifting up wages for the lower earner, but by suppressing wages for the higher earner. Evidence suggests this is exactly what the Paycheck Fairness Act would do. Denmark has a similar law that requires employers to report pay to the government. A recent study found that while the requirement reduced the pay gap by 2 percentage points, it did so primarily by lowering men’s wages, not by raising women’s. It also lowered businesses’ overall productivity, though their bottom line remained intact, since they reduced employee wages by 2.8 percent. Proponents of this policy should ask: Is this really helping anyone? 3. No more pay based on performance. Performance-based pay is increasingly common, and it makes perfect sense. When workers earn pay based on their own output, they become more productive because they are driven by an incentive to earn more. Studies have shown that average wages rise by 6 to 10 percent when companies adopt performance-based pay. Under the Paycheck Fairness Act this would go away. A woman would be able to sue if she did not receive the same performance-based bonus as a male colleague. She could argue that the bonus was not a “business necessity,” or that the company failed to provide her with training that would have allowed her to earn the same bonus. This would force uniform pay scales on all workers and would eliminate the possibility of earning a high-performance bonus or a wage increase based on performance. 4. Hurting employers and employees while benefiting trial attorneys. Lawsuits are extremely costly, and the Paycheck Fairness Act would make gender-based pay lawsuits more widespread and exponentially more expensive. When lawsuits occur, the result would be windfall benefits for trial attorneys, large payments for plaintiffs, and big financial hits to employers, who would have to cut costs by potentially laying off workers and cutting wages, or closing shop altogether. Defending against frivolous lawsuits would prove so risky that businesses would likely opt to enact uniform pay scales that would flatten employee pay and benefits, regardless of the unique contributions of individual workers. This would make businesses less productive overall and even result in less pay for workers. This proposal is full of unintended consequences, and would surely backfire on both women and men. Instead of trying to micromanage employers’ practices in an effort to artificially force women’s wages to match those of men’s, policymakers should focus on reducing barriers to opportunity and supporting women in the choices they make for themselves. Congress can do this by rolling back its extensive reach into female-dominated sectors of the economy, such as health care and elderly care, which crowds out opportunities for women-owned businesses and restricts women’s wage growth. Lawmakers should also let workers choose who represents them in employer-employee negotiations (ending exclusive union representation), and pass bills such as the Working Families Flexibility Act that would give workers a choice between receiving pay or paid time off in exchange for overtime hours. Finally, state policymakers should look to slash regulations that drive up the cost of child care. Doing so would indirectly create new work opportunities for women."},

Of course those aren’t the exact words she used, but when “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” are elevated to protected classes in antidiscrimination law, that’s the effect that the government policy has. But not every disagreement is discrimination, and our law shouldn’t suppose otherwise. The Heritage Foundation has long opposed the expansion of antidiscrimination laws to elevate “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” as protected classes. Where enacted, these laws—known as SOGI laws—are frequently used as swords to persecute people with unpopular beliefs, rather than as shields to protect people from unjust discrimination. Part of the problem with these laws is that they treat reasonable actions as if discriminatory. So, for example, if a baker creates custom wedding cakes for marriages, but won’t design or create them for same-sex unions, that’s considered “discrimination” on the basis of “sexual orientation.” If a Catholic adoption agency works to find permanent homes for orphans where they’ll be raised by a married mom and dad, but won’t place children with two moms and no dad, or two dads and no mom, that’s considered “discrimination” on the basis of “sexual orientation.” If a small business provides health insurance that covers a double mastectomy in the case of breast cancer, but not for women who want to transition and identify as men, that’s considered “discrimination” on the basis of “gender identity.” If a school provides separate bathrooms and locker rooms for male and female students, but won’t let male students who identify as women into the female places, that’s considered “discrimination” on the basis of “gender identity.” These reasonable policies on disputed questions should not be penalized by the government as if discriminatory. Of course, business owners should respect the intrinsic dignity of all of their employees and customers. But this isn’t what laws on sexual orientation and gender identity entail. Their threats to our freedoms unite civil libertarians concerned about free speech and religious liberty, free-market proponents concerned about freedom of contract and governmental overregulation, and social conservatives concerned about marriage and culture. America is dedicated to protecting the freedoms guaranteed under the First Amendment to the Constitution, while respecting citizens’ equality before the law. None of these freedoms is absolute. Compelling governmental interests can at times trump fundamental civil liberties, but laws on sexual identity and gender identity do not pass this test. Rather, they trample First Amendment rights and unnecessarily impinge on citizens’ right to run their local schools, charities, and businesses in ways consistent with their values. These laws do not protect equality before the law. Instead, they grant special privileges that are enforceable against private actors. These laws could also have serious unintended consequences. These laws tend to be vague and overly broad, lacking clear definitions of what discrimination on the basis of “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” mean and what conduct can and cannot be penalized. These laws would impose ruinous liability on innocent citizens for alleged “discrimination” based on subjective and unverifiable identities, not on objective traits. They would further increase government interference in markets, potentially discouraging economic growth and job creation. By making “gender identity” a protected class, the government would force Americans to embrace transgender ideology in a variety of settings—with serious consequences for schoolhouses, locker rooms, hospitals, and workplace policies that undermine common sense. Schools would have to redo their bathroom, locker room, and dorm room policies to allow students access based on their subjective identity, rather than their objective biology. Employers would have to do the same and force all employees to use “preferred pronouns,” as well as cover hormonal and surgical transition procedures in their health care plans. Hospitals would have to provide these procedures, and relevant physicians would have to perform them. In essence, elevating “gender identity” to a protected class across our federal antidiscrimination laws could impose a nationwide transgender bathroom policy, a nationwide pronoun policy, and a nationwide sex-reassignment health care mandate. Already the Department of Education is investigating a complaint from a 5-year-old girl who says she was sexually assaulted by a male classmate who was allowed access to the girls’ bathroom. Last year, Melody Wood and I documented over 130 examples of men charged with using access to bathrooms, locker rooms, and showers to target women for voyeurism and sexual assault. SOGI laws threaten the freedom of citizens, individually and in associations, to affirm their religious or moral convictions—convictions such as that marriage is the union of one man and one woman or that maleness and femaleness are objective biological realities to be valued and affirmed, not rejected or altered. Under these laws, acting on these beliefs in a charitable, educational, or commercial context could be actionable discrimination. These laws are the ones that have been used to penalize bakers, florists, photographers, schools, and adoption agencies when they declined to act against their convictions concerning marriage and sexuality. They do not adequately protect religious liberty or freedom of speech. In short, laws on sexual orientation and gender identity seek to regulate decisions that are best handled by private actors without government interference. They disregard the conscience and liberty of people of good will who happen not to share the government’s opinions about issues of marriage and sexuality based on a reasonable worldview, moral code, or religious faith. Accordingly, these laws risk becoming sources of social tension rather than unity. Instead of treating disagreement as if it were discrimination, Americans of all walks of life must strive to peacefully coexist even when we don’t see eye to eye. How sad that Pelosi has already announced her intention to legislate division and punish disagreement."},
{"title": "Shields, Not Swords", "author": ["Ryan T. Anderson, Ph.D."], "date": "May 7, 2018 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/shields-not-swords", "takeaways": [], "text": "Public debates about sensitive issues of culture, identity, and sexuality often get tangled up in terms and concepts. In particular, we confuse \"rights\" and \"needs\" in ways that in turn confuse our understanding of the appropriate role of government in these arenas. Untangling this knot is a first step toward fruitful debate of these sensitive matters. There are certain rights that all people possess irrespective of their identity. Among these are the rights to life, liberty (including religious liberty), and the pursuit of happiness. Government exists to protect, not violate, these rights. At the same time, there are certain needs that everyone has, regardless of their identity. Government, in some cases, has an obligation to help people meet those needs, and in other cases, it has an obligation to allow people to meet them on their own, by prohibiting others from preventing any person from meeting his own needs. So, for instance, government directly meets the needs of the poor through certain welfare programs, and it also prevents private entities from blocking people from meeting their own needs through certain anti-discrimination statutes. Some people argue that citizens who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (which I will describe here as LGBT) are being blocked from meeting their needs, and that a governmental response is necessary. But if a governmental response is indeed the necessary remedy, any such response to help citizens meet their needs must not unduly impede other people's basic rights, including the freedoms of speech, association, and religion. As Americans continue to disagree about sex and marriage, we must find ways to help citizens meet their needs without weaponizing the redefinitions of marriage, sex, and gender in ways that would prevent other citizens from exercising their rights and meeting their own needs. In other words, if an anti-discrimination policy is needed in a certain context to protect citizens from mistreatment that hampers their full participation in civil society, such policies ought to be understood as shields, not swords. But sexual-orientation and gender-identity (SOGI) policies are now often being used as swords to \"punish the wicked,\" as Tim Gill (their biggest financial backer) has put it. Lawmakers, public-interest firms, civil-rights commissioners, and judges seem to agree with Gill. For many, it isn't sufficient that same-sex couples can marry in the state's eyes: Their relationships must count as marriages in the eyes of their fellow citizens, who must be compelled to facilitate such unions. Likewise, not only must citizens be free to adopt transgender identities, but others must be compelled to recognize and accept them. In short, policies intended to allow people who identify as LGBT to meet their needs are being used illiberally, to impose a new sexual orthodoxy on the nation. But as the Supreme Court acknowledged in Obergefell v. Hodges, the conviction that male and female are created for each other \"has been held — and continues to be held — in good faith by reasonable and sincere people here and throughout the world.\" Indeed, the Court added, many \"reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here.\" Any fair policy will take heed of this point; it will address the particular needs of LGBT individuals without punishing other reasonable citizens for acting on decent and honorable beliefs. Thus, we shouldn't simply assume that the best policy for protecting LGBT individuals is to add the phrase \"sexual orientation and gender identity\" to existing laws crafted to respond to racism and sexism, as SOGI laws do. Rather, lawmakers must carefully specify what constitutes \"discrimination\" on the basis of \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity,\" so as to avoid punishing innocent actions and interactions. They should carefully consider which entities to regulate, so as to keep burdens to a minimum. And they should accommodate freedoms of speech, association, and religion. On each of these dimensions, our laws have treated racial discrimination differently from sex-based discrimination, and with good reasons. Our laws have also drawn complex and sophisticated distinctions in protecting religious liberty. Thinking through these differences can help us draw some distinctions that will be useful to thinking about SOGI laws, and help us reverse and avoid some key mistakes. Anti-gay and anti-transgender bigotry exists and should be condemned. But support for marriage defined as the union of husband and wife isn't anti-gay. Nor is the conviction that sex is a biological reality anti-transgender. Just as we've combatted sexism without treating pro-life medicine as sexist, we should make sure that any public policy necessary to help people who identify as LGBT meet their needs is crafted in a way that respects the consciences of reasonable people acting on good-faith beliefs about marriage and gender identity. Not every disagreement is discrimination. And our law shouldn't suppose otherwise. DEFINING DISCRIMINATION Discrimination in the broad sense — the making of distinctions — is inevitable. In the moralized, pejorative sense, discrimination involves mistreatment based on irrelevant factors. For clarity, I use \"distinguish\" as a neutral term and \"discriminate\" to refer to wrongful distinctions — those based on irrelevant factors. We can distinguish or discriminate based on X when we take X as a reason for treating someone differently. Of course, there might be some traits on which we both distinguish and discriminate, and disentangling the two can take work: A school distinguishes based on sex when it creates male and female bathrooms; it discriminates based on sex when it allows men to study economics while forcing women to stick to home economics. But doctors neither distinguish nor discriminate based on sex when they decline to perform abortions, as the sex of the pregnant person plays no role in their reasoning. One problem with current SOGI laws is that they fail to specify appropriately what constitutes discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. These laws can be over-enforced because of this failure to establish clear boundaries between invidious and appropriate distinctions. We can better understand such boundaries by considering how they manifest in some specific cases of putative \"discrimination\" based on race and sex. Public policy is nuanced enough to capture important differences in these cases; it should do the same with regard to SOGI. Invidious discrimination is rooted in unfair, socially debilitating ideas about individuals' abilities or proper social status. Racially segregated water fountains are a clear example of race-based discrimination; the creators of those laws took race into account where it was utterly irrelevant, in a way that treated blacks as socially inferior. That's what made them forms of invidious race-based discrimination. Given that such discrimination was entrenched, widespread, and state-sponsored, Congress rightly stepped in. Likewise, throughout much of American history, girls and women were not afforded educational opportunities equal to those available to boys and men. This form of discrimination took sex into consideration; it treated girls and women differently — and worse — precisely because of their sex, depriving them of educational opportunities for which they were qualified. That's what made this invidious discrimination. Its entrenchment justified Title IX of the Education Amendments. These are clear examples of invidious discrimination. Yet Title IX's implementing regulations made clear that sex-specific housing, bathrooms, and locker rooms did not constitute unlawful discrimination. Such policies take sex into consideration, but not invidiously. They treat both sexes equally because they take sex into consideration (they \"discriminate\" — in the non-pejorative sense of \"distinguish\" — on the basis of sex) only where it's relevant; they respect the fact that bodily sexual differences raise legitimate privacy interests in some settings. It would serve equality only in the most artificial (and unimportant) sense to force men and women, boys and girls, to undress in front of each other. Indeed, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in her 1996 opinion for the Supreme Court explaining why the Virginia Military Institute had to become co-ed, took it for granted that the Court's decision \"would undoubtedly require alterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in living arrangements.\" Likewise, when critics decades earlier had argued that the Equal Rights Amendment, a failed predecessor of Title IX, would have required unisex intimate facilities, Ginsburg (then a Columbia law professor) dismissed this claim in a Washington Post op-ed: \"Again, emphatically not so. Separate places to disrobe, sleep, perform personal bodily functions are permitted, in some situations required, by regard for individual privacy. Individual privacy, a right of constitutional dimension, is appropriately harmonized with the equality principle.\" While concern for privacy requires separate facilities for males and females, it can't justify race-specific facilities, which is why the latter really would undermine equality — and discriminate invidiously. Hence our civil-rights laws abolished separate facilities for blacks and whites, but not for males and females. The key point to notice is that policymakers did not treat sex-specific intimate facilities as discriminatory in the first place. It was the regulations themselves that allowed for sex-specific facilities, not exemptions for a mere subset of regulated actors. The lesson is that we can't assume that different protected statuses — in this case race and sex — should have exactly the same legal implications. Each requires tailoring in light of when the status in question is and isn't relevant, and what scope of protections is required to restore a group's equal opportunities. Unfortunately, SOGI laws have not been carefully tailored in their drafting or application. Pro-life doctors offer a different kind of case: If sex-specific intimate facilities take sex into account in a legitimate way, pro-life medical practices make nothing hinge on sex at all. That only women can get pregnant has no bearing on the judgment of the conscientious doctor or nurse who refuses to kill the unborn, a judgment based on respect for prenatal life. This point is only reinforced by the insistence of LGBT advocates that men can become pregnant: Even in such cases, pro-life medical personnel would refuse to perform abortions. So it would be a gross misapplication of sex anti-discrimination laws to say that a Catholic hospital refusing to perform abortions is discriminating based on sex. Even those who support abortion access needn't support coercing pro-life doctors or hospitals, since any disparate impact created by pro-life practices doesn't prevent people from obtaining abortions elsewhere. Thus, we can identify three different types of cases, based on different sets of conditions. First, there are cases of invidious discrimination, in which an irrelevant factor is (wrongfully and harmfully) taken into consideration, as with racially segregated water fountains. Second are cases of distinctions that should not count as unlawful discrimination, in which a factor is taken into consideration precisely because it is relevant, and no one is wronged or harmed, as with sex-specific intimate facilities. And in a third category are policies that don't involve distinctions based on a given trait at all (even if they have a disparate impact on one particular subset of the population), which our law can tolerate without hampering the affected group's participation in civil society, as with pro-life medicine. To avoid unduly burdening sensible and often crucial practices, any policy proposal to address the needs of people who identify as LGBT must, as a prerequisite, be warranted on the basis of the first set of conditions. DISCRIMINATION AND DISAGREEMENT Applying such distinctions to the kinds of cases for which SOGI laws are crafted can help us tell the difference between actual discrimination and reasonable disagreement. Consider a florist who refused to serve all customers who identify as LGBT simply because of their LGBT status. He would be discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity because he takes these into consideration precisely so that he can treat those customers differently. Such discrimination would be invidious because it is irrational — not simply mistaken, but altogether unreasonable — to see any connection between the decision to sell flowers and a customer's gender identity or sexual orientation. Jack Phillips, by contrast, didn't discriminate — or even distinguish — based on sexual orientation when he refused to design and bake a cake for a same-sex wedding. He didn't take his customer's sexual orientation into consideration at all. He declined to use his artistic abilities to create a custom cake to celebrate a same-sex wedding because he objected to same-sex marriage, based on the common Christian belief that such partnerships (along with many other relationships — sexual and not, dyadic and larger, same-sex and opposite-sex) aren't marital. Nowhere need Phillips's reasoning have even referred to the partners' sexual orientation, much less any ideas or attitudes about gay people as a class (good or bad, explicit or not). Both Justices Samuel Alito and Anthony Kennedy seemed to grasp the importance of this point during oral arguments in Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. When Phillips declined to create a cake for a same-sex wedding, Colorado wouldn't even recognize — let alone issue — same-sex marriage licenses. Justice Alito observed that Phillips's customer couldn't get the state of Colorado to recognize his relationship as a marriage, \"[a]nd yet when he goes to this bake shop, and he says I want a wedding cake, and the baker says, no, I won't do it, in part because same-sex marriage was not allowed in Colorado at the time, he's created a grave wrong....How does [all that] fit together?\" Indeed, Colorado should have never declared Phillips guilty of discrimination in the first place. And — in what might prove to be the most important comment made during oral arguments — Justice Kennedy appeared to reject the ACLU's argument that opposition to same-sex marriage just is discrimination against people who identify as gay. Kennedy explained Phillips's beliefs: \"Look, suppose he says, 'I have nothing against gay people,' he says. 'But I just don't think they should have a marriage because that's contrary to my beliefs. It's not their identity; it's what they're doing.'\" In response to the ACLU's claim that this is sexual-orientation discrimination, Kennedy responded, \"Your identity thing is just too facile.\" It wasn't his customer's identity that motivated Phillips at all. It is even clearer that Phillips's reason for refusing to bake the wedding cake was not the invidious purpose, essential to Jim Crow, of avoiding contact with others on equal terms. As Phillips said to the same-sex couple, \"I'll make you birthday cakes, shower cakes, sell you cookies and brownies, I just don't make cakes for same-sex weddings.\" He sought only to avoid complicity in what he considered one distortion of marriage among others — as shown by his refusal to create divorce cakes as well. By and large, such refusals simply reflect what the Supreme Court has recognized as a disagreement about marriage among people of good faith motivated by honorable premises. Applying anti-discrimination policy here amounts to an enforcement of sexual orthodoxy on reasonably disputed questions: It punishes people for acting on reasonable views of marriage. This is seen most clearly in the case of Catholic Charities adoption agencies. They decline to place the children entrusted to their care with same-sex couples not because of the partners' sexual orientation, but because of the conviction that children deserve both a mother and a father. These agencies believe that men and women are not interchangeable, that mothers and fathers are not replaceable. Catholic Charities does not think that people who identify as LGBT cannot love or care for children, but that the two best dads in the world cannot make up for a missing mom, and the two best moms in the world cannot make up for a missing dad. This policy doesn't take sexual orientation into consideration at all. It simply reflects a reasonable disagreement about the importance of both mothering and fathering. The contrast with opposition to interracial marriage proves that the latter did discriminate, invidiously, based on race. Anti-miscegenationists opposed interracial marriage precisely because one of the spouses was black, and therefore supposedly incompetent, impure, or threatening to whites (especially women). This opposition rested on the idea that blacks were inferior and thus shouldn't interact with whites on an equal plane, least of all in marriage. Thus, a baker refusing to bake for an interracial wedding discriminates invidiously on the basis of race. He takes that factor — race — into consideration, and does so where it is irrelevant. His behavior thus perpetuates damaging myths about blacks that impede their full participation in society. This is only confirmed by the fact that anti-miscegenation laws (and beliefs) are outliers in history, arising only in cultures that had race-based caste systems. For all these reasons, when the Supreme Court struck down bans on interracial marriage, it did not and could not say that opposition to miscegenation \"has been held — and continues to be held — in good faith by reasonable and sincere people here and throughout the world.\" Meanwhile, support for marriage as the conjugal union of husband and wife has been a human universal until just recently, regardless of a culture's views about sexual orientation or same-sex relations. This view of marriage is based on the capacity that a man and a woman possess to unite in a conjugal act, create new life, and support that new life with both a mother and a father. Whether ultimately sound or not, this view is reasonable and disparages no one. If Obergefell was about respecting the freedom of people who identify as gay to live as they wish, the law should respect the same freedom for Americans who believe in the conjugal understanding of marriage. No doubt many people oppose the conjugal view of marriage. But, to quote the Court in Obergefell, when that \"personal opposition becomes enacted law and public policy, the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the State itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied.\" Anti-discrimination law should be a shield to protect, not a sword to demean, stigmatize, and deny liberty to traditional Muslims, Jews, Christians, and other believers. Charges of discrimination based on gender identity often suffer from similar problems. The Washington Post recently reported on a woman suing a Catholic hospital for its refusal to perform a sex-reassignment procedure on her that entailed removing her healthy uterus. Comments in that Post report exemplify the common conflation of real and invidious discrimination with reasonable disagreement: \"What the rule says is if you provide a particular service to anybody, you can't refuse to provide it to anyone,\" said Sarah Warbelow, the legal director for the Human Rights Campaign. That means a transgender person who shows up at an emergency room with something as basic as a twisted ankle cannot be denied care, as sometimes happens, Warbelow said. That also means if a doctor provides breast reconstruction surgery or hormone therapy, those services cannot be denied to transgender patients seeking them for gender dysphoria, she said. The two examples given, however, differ crucially. A hospital that refused to treat the twisted ankles of people who identified as transgender simply because they so identified would be discriminating invidiously, but a hospital that declined to remove the healthy uterus of a woman identifying as a man would not be engaging in gender-identity discrimination. In the first case, the hospital takes a patient's transgender identity into consideration where it is utterly irrelevant and then treats the patient worse precisely because of it. But in the second case, the gender identity of the patient doesn't play a role in the decision-making at all: Just as pro-life physicians do not kill unborn babies, regardless of the pregnant person's gender identity, some doctors refuse to remove healthy uteruses from anyone, regardless of their gender identity. Their decision simply reflects reasonable disagreement over the best medicine for gender dysphoria and indeed the nature of medicine altogether, including whether it can ever allow for the removal of healthy organs. We shouldn't use anti-discrimination policies to enforce political orthodoxy on reasonably disputed questions of medical care. That would make them swords, not shields. As for the Human Rights Campaign spokesperson's claim that emergency rooms \"sometimes\" refuse to treat the twisted ankles of transgender patients, there is no evidence — including on the HRC's website — that this or anything similar has in fact happened. Just as reasonable medical treatments for gender dysphoria do not discriminate based on gender identity, neither do reasonable policies on sex-specific facilities. The bathroom, locker-room, and housing policies at stake in this debate make reasonable — and explicitly lawful — distinctions based on sex: anatomy, physiology, biology. These policies do not take gender identity into account at all, let alone in an invidious way. The fact that some people wear suits and ties and others wear dresses is not the reason we keep separate bathrooms and locker rooms for men and women. The existence of sex-specific intimate facilities is explained not by our internal sense or social expressions of gender but by the external manifestations of our biology. By contrast, it would be invidious discrimination based on gender identity to say that students who identified with their biological sex could use one water fountain, while others had to use another. This would involve taking transgender status into account, and doing so where gender identity was irrelevant. Thus, lawmakers shouldn't use SOGI laws to punish actions rooted in the conjugal view of marriage, medical practices rooted in reasonable views about medicine and bodily integrity, or policies about intimate facilities that reflect reasonable views of privacy. Just as bans on sex-based discrimination don't force pro-lifers to perform abortions, these reasonable actions shouldn't be banned under SOGI laws at all. Rather than grant exemptions from SOGI laws to allow some regulated actors to have these policies, we shouldn't ban them in the first place. CORRECTING BAD ANALOGIES Some argue that it's inconsistent to support religious liberty but not SOGI laws, or to support bans on discrimination based on religion but not based on SOGI. Both objections miss striking and telling differences between these pairs of policies. Neither shows an inconsistency in those who oppose SOGI laws. First, under anti-discrimination laws, the government coerces some citizens on behalf of others; by contrast, civil liberties limit government to protect the personal freedom of all. Thus, anti-discrimination laws force some to live by the majority's values; religious-liberty laws protect the interest of all to live by their own beliefs. And while there can be good justifications for certain anti-discrimination policies in certain circumstances, there is no human right to them, as there is to religious liberty. Second, SOGI anti-discrimination laws are used not simply as shields to protect citizens from unjust discrimination, but as swords to punish reasonable people for acting on honorable beliefs — in a way that religious (and other) anti-discrimination laws are not. That is, bans on religion-based discrimination are not used to force religious organizations to violate their sincere religious beliefs, nor are they used to force secular organizations to violate their deeply held convictions. Religious anti-discrimination policies have not been used, for example, to force Planned Parenthood to hire pro-life Catholics. No one filed a legal complaint claiming it was unlawful, religion-based discrimination when Mozilla Firefox forced out CEO Brendan Eich because he had donated to California's marriage initiative — even though his donations were rooted in his religious identity and its constitutive beliefs. Likewise, when A&E suspended Phil Robertson from Duck Dynasty because he expressed support for Biblical views of sexuality, Americans who objected to this decision did not allege that it violated religious anti-discrimination policies. Religious anti-discrimination laws simply do not seek to impose religious orthodoxy on the country. But again, SOGI anti-discrimination policies are used to impose sexual orthodoxy. They're used to try to force Catholic schools to employ people who undermine their sexual values, and to force evangelical bakers to lend their artistic talents to support messages about marriage with which they disagree. Religious anti-discrimination laws are not used to punish those the majority considers wrong on religion. Just the opposite, in fact; these protections are equally available to all religions, including minority faiths. This difference flows partly from differences in how SOGI and religious anti-discrimination laws are interpreted. SOGI laws are read to protect not only gay, lesbian, or bisexual orientations and transgender identities, but also to protect forms of conduct taken to flow from these statuses. But the laws themselves never address which conduct counts. This leaves human-rights commissioners and judges free to decide (as they often do) that it is gender-identity discrimination for Planet Fitness to base locker-room access on biology, not identity, and that it is sexual-orientation discrimination for Catholic Charities to seek out a mom and a dad for every child in need based simply on the conviction that kids benefit from both fathering and mothering. But the law is much more nuanced regarding when it does or doesn't protect conduct (in addition to status) under other anti-discrimination laws. Religious anti-discrimination laws apply to status and certain religiously inspired conduct, but not to such an extent as to impose a religious orthodoxy — they do not force other actors to undermine their own missions. Planned Parenthood can't refuse to hire a pro-choice Jew because he wears a yarmulke, for example, but it can refuse to hire a pro-life Jew, even when his pro-life convictions flow from his Jewish status and identity. This leaves Planned Parenthood free to make reasonable distinctions based on its mission, even when living by that mission has a disparate impact on people with a certain religious identity and conduct. Likewise, even if same-sex relationships flow from gay and lesbian identities, supporters of conjugal marriage shouldn't be coerced under SOGI anti-discrimination laws — and yet they are. Even if cross-dressing flows from transgender identity, a policy against biological males' entering a women's locker room shouldn't be viewed as discrimination based on gender identity. Indeed, as noted, sex anti-discrimination laws already allow for such reasonable policies. As for race anti-discrimination laws, they apply almost exclusively to status, because there is no conduct that flows from race. And so, while race anti-discrimination laws do impose an orthodoxy on the nation — color-blindness — that's justified because there's no reasonable, decent, and honorable alternative view. Thus, SOGI anti-discrimination policies are fundamentally unlike civil-rights laws that protect against discrimination on the basis of race, sex, and even religion. The latter reflect nuanced understandings of what constitutes unlawful discrimination and do not squeeze other fundamental values. They are not used as swords to enforce orthodoxy against people's reasonable, decent, and honorable disagreements, but as shields to protect people from unjust discrimination that prevents their full participation in society and their ability to flourish. THE GOALS OF POLICY Thus, to craft any policy necessary to protect people who identify as LGBT and enable them to meet their needs without undermining the common good, lawmakers must precisely identify the need to be met, tailor the scope of any policy remedy appropriately to that need, and carefully distinguish which circumstances count as discrimination and which do not. And they must avoid gratuitous burdens on conduct flowing from reasonable disagreement or on the rights of conscience, religion, and speech. Of course, what counts as a gratuitous burden will depend on the needs being addressed. When the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was enacted, blacks were treated as second-class citizens. Individuals, businesses, and associations across the country excluded blacks in ways that caused grave material and social harms without justification, without market forces acting as a corrective, and with the tacit and often explicit backing of government. So resort to the law was necessary. And because race is almost always irrelevant, and discrimination on its basis was so firmly entrenched, the law was appropriately broad and allowed only very limited exemptions. Contrast to that the case of sex-based discrimination. The law treated it differently because the nature and history of racism are different from those of sexism. The scope of federal anti-discrimination laws was narrower in the case of sex, and allowed broader exemptions. Thus, for example, federal law even today doesn't ban sex discrimination in public accommodations. It expressly allows for sex-specific intimate facilities. And it offers broader exemptions for religious-liberty claimants. In other words, the scope of regulation and the definition of discrimination were broader in the case of race than that of sex. These two realities are different and gave rise to different needs. Likewise, the case of SOGI is different from both sex and race. We never had an analogue of Jim Crow for people who identify as LGBT. There are no denials of the right to vote, no lynchings, no signs over water fountains saying \"Gay\" and \"Straight.\" Of course, bigotry against those who identify as LGBT exists, and our communities must fight it. But it would be too crude — and too burdensome on important interests in religion, speech, and the like — to adopt for SOGI anti-discrimination laws that were written to respond to Jim Crow and then tack on some exemptions. That becomes clear when one considers the cases to which SOGI laws are most controversially applied. These involve an astonishingly small number of business owners who cannot in good conscience support same-sex wedding celebrations. Most, like Jack Phillips, treat people who identify as gay with respect while simply declining to help celebrate or facilitate same-sex weddings. Professor Andrew Koppelman, a longtime LGBT advocate, acknowledges as much: Hardly any of these cases have occurred: a handful in a country of 300 million people. In all of them, the people who objected to the law were asked directly to facilitate same-sex relationships, by providing wedding, adoption, or artificial insemination services, counseling, or rental of bedrooms. There have been no claims of a right to simply refuse to deal with gay people. There is no movement to deny people who identify as LGBT access to markets or goods and services. Indeed, there is a reason why there have been \"no claims of a right to simply refuse to deal with gay people\": No faith teaches it. Take it from legal scholar, religious-liberty expert, and longtime same-sex-marriage supporter Douglas Laycock: \"I know of no American religious group that teaches discrimination against gays as such, and few judges would be persuaded of the sincerity of such a claim. The religious liberty issue with respect to gays and lesbians is about directly facilitating the marriage, as with wedding services and marital counseling.\" In this vein, as noted by Robin Fretwell Wilson, another religious-liberty scholar, \"The religious and moral convictions that motivate objectors to refuse to facilitate same-sex marriage simply cannot be marshaled to justify racial discrimination.\" In a word, the refusals of bakers like Phillips have nothing like the sweep or shape of racist or sexist practices. They don't span every domain — or even the professional sphere — but focus on marriage and sex. They're about refusing to communicate certain messages about marriage, not avoiding contact with certain people. Barronelle Stutzman, who declined to create floral arrangements to celebrate the same-sex wedding of her client whom she had served for nearly 10 years, clearly didn't think gay people vicious, incompetent, or unproductive. She didn't think they mattered less or deserved shunning. She employed them and served them faithfully as clients, gladly creating anything else they requested. As Professor Koppelman writes, \"These people are not homophobic bigots who want to hurt gay people.\" The few cases of refusals that have garnered media attention — cases involving cake designers, a florist, and a photographer — hardly diminish a single person or couple's range of opportunities for room, board, or entertainment. If businesses started to refuse service specifically to individuals who identify as gay, it is hard to imagine a sector of commerce or a region of our country where media coverage would not provide a remedy swift and decisive enough to restore access — or shutter the business — in a matter of days. The LGBT community's political influence is immense and still growing. When corporate giants like the NBA, the NCAA, Apple, Salesforce, Delta, and the Coca-Cola Company threaten to boycott states over laws that merely give believers their day in court, it's hard to see the case for penalizing the one baker in the state who concludes he can't make cakes for same-sex weddings. Finally, progressives like Professor Koppelman have noted that cultural pressures fast at work weaken the case for legal coercion: \"With respect to the religious condemnation of homosexuality, this marginalization is already taking place. That does not mean, however, that the conservatives need to be punished or driven out of the marketplace. There remains room for the kind of cold respect that toleration among exclusivist religions entails.\" Elsewhere he expands: \"The reshaping of culture to marginalize anti-gay discrimination is inevitable. To say it again: The gay rights movement has won. It will not be stopped by a few exemptions. It should be magnanimous in victory.\" A BETTER MODEL In 1993, in Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, the Supreme Court resolutely rejected the argument that pro-lifers are inherently discriminatory: \"Whatever one thinks of abortion, it cannot be denied that there are common and respectable reasons for opposing it, other than hatred of, or condescension toward (or indeed any view at all concerning), women.\" The same is true when it comes to marriage as the union of husband and wife: There are common and respectable reasons for supporting it that have nothing to do with hatred or condescension. But this is not true when it comes to opposition to interracial marriage — and this is where the analogies to racism break down. When the Supreme Court struck down bans on interracial marriage, it did not say that opposition to interracial marriage was based on \"decent and honorable premises\" and held \"in good faith by reasonable and sincere people here and throughout the world.\" It did not say it, because it is not true. As a result, following Obergefell, our policy toward supporters of the conjugal view of marriage should mirror our policy toward pro-lifers after Roe v. Wade — not our policy toward racists after Loving v. Virginia. After Roe, Americans didn't use the new court-mandated legal regime around abortion as a sword to punish pro-lifers. They did just the opposite: They enacted legislation at the local, state, and federal levels to protect the rights of pro-life Americans not to be punished by government for living out their beliefs. The Church and Weldon Amendments have protected the conscience rights of pro-life medical personnel to refuse to perform or assist with abortions, and the Hyde Amendment and Mexico City policy prevent the use of taxpayer money to support abortion. Likewise, governments must avoid penalizing people for acting on their view that marriage is the union of husband and wife, that sexual relations are properly reserved for such a union, or that maleness and femaleness are objective biological realities. Protections for such citizens need not undermine the valid purposes of laws meant to protect LGBT individuals — such as eliminating the public effects of anti-gay bigotry — because support for conjugal marriage isn't anti-gay. Protecting the right to religious freedom here sends no message about any supposed inferiority of gay Americans; it sends no message about sexual orientation at all. Rather, such protection says that citizens who support the historic understanding of sex and marriage are not bigots. It ensures their equal social status and opportunities. It guards their ability to provide for their own needs, by protecting businesses, livelihoods, professional vocations, and (perhaps eventually) professional licenses in fields like medicine and law. And it benefits the rest of society by allowing traditional people of faith to continue offering social services and education in good conscience. In short, pro-life conscience protections do not undermine Roe v. Wade or women's equality. Neither do conscience protections for conjugal-marriage supporters undermine Obergefell or LGBT equality. Both protect the human dignity and human rights of those who dissent from prevailing social norms. Both promote the common good as shields, not swords."},

The real question is, how can that be achieved? What many don’t realize is that women’s advancement doesn’t require gender quotas or affirmative action. What’s needed, above all, is free market policies that allow women to make their own choices. Ivanka Trump understands that as few do. Last month, she tweeted out her support for the Women’s Entrepreneurship and Economic Empowerment Act, a bill that emphasizes that a woman’s economic power has positive implications for both her family and her personal fulfillment. Not surprisingly, empowering women with greater economic choice and control is really about advancing their economic freedom. Countries that implement free market policies essentially enable women to make their own decisions. Because economic freedom creates greater opportunities for entrepreneurship, there are also more and better jobs for women available in free economies than in less-free economies. As shown in the accompanying chart, there is also a striking relationship between economic freedom and gender equality. The strongly positive relationship between economic freedom, prosperity, and gender equality highlights the importance of empowering men and women alike with the freedom to improve their lives through greater opportunities to work, produce, save, and invest. As shown by the chart below, nations across different regions with higher scores in The Heritage Foundation’s 2018 Index of Economic Freedom enjoy higher gross domestic product per capita. But the benefits of economic freedom extend as well to better health, education, and protection of the environment. Unfortunately, institutional barriers to women’s economic empowerment remain in many countries. For example, the World Economic Forum reports that women in 18 countries, including Bahrain, Iran, Sudan, and United Arab Emirates, still have to obtain permission from their spouses to pursue employment. Furthermore, the World Bank reports that in 81 countries it is permissible by law for creditors to discriminate “on the basis of sex or gender.” That includes most low-, lower-middle-, and upper-middle-income countries, where the gender gap in capital access is holding back potential economic progress. Terry Miller, director of The Heritage Foundation’s Center for International Trade and Economics and a former ambassador, once spoke on the importance of women’s liberty at the United Nations’ Commission on the Status of Women: Ensuring and spreading economic freedom for women is the best way to empower them and to propel an economy forward."},
{"title": "Massachusetts Can Protect Women and Kids", "author": ["Monica  Burke"], "date": "Nov 6, 2018 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/massachusetts-can-protect-women-and-kids", "takeaways": ["The law in question, passed in 2016, changed state law so that access to sex-specific spaces would be granted not on the basis of sex, but of gender identity.", "A gender identity standard makes it harder to prove that predators intended to commit a crime—not to mention that law enforcement may be reluctant to get involved.", "Only when we can guarantee the privacy and safety of women and children can we pursue solutions that meet the needs of all citizens."], "text": "This election cycle, there’s a question on the Massachusetts ballot on whether to keep in place a state law that poses a serious threat to the privacy and safety of women and children. Question 3 on the state ballot asks if residents of the state would like to keep in place the current law, which “prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender identity in places of public accommodation,” allowing biological males to access the personal facilities of females and vice versa. Repealing the law would make Massachusetts a safer place, especially for women and children. The law in question, passed in 2016, changed state law so that access to sex-specific spaces would be granted not on the basis of sex, but of gender identity. The law defines gender identity as “a person’s sincerely held gender-related identity, appearance, or behavior, whether or not it is different from that traditionally associated with the person’s physiology or assigned sex at birth.” It is not difficult to imagine the implications of this policy. Take, for example, what happened to the 5-year-old daughter of Pascha Thomas under a similar policy in Decatur, Georgia. In 2017, Thomas’ daughter was assaulted by a male classmate who identified as female in the girls’ restroom at kindergarten. When Thomas brought the incident to the attention of the school, it claimed that there was nothing it could do, given the school’s policy, since it granted access to sex-specific facilities on the basis of the preference of the individual student. State Sen. Eric Lesser, a Democrat and co-sponsor of the original 2016 bill—signed into law by a nominal Republican governor, Charlie Baker—downplayed the concerns of women and parents, accusing them of  “fearmongering.” However, the senator fails to realize the full implications of this policy. The law’s definition neglects to provide a standard for who can claim access to a given space. Without a clear, objective biological standard, the law is rendered unable to determine who belongs where. A 2017 Heritage Foundation report documented more than 130 cases of predators taking advantage of such policies to gain access to victims in restrooms, locker rooms, and shower areas. When women and children can no longer expect a clear standard to determine who can and cannot be present in sex-specific spaces, they become less likely to report inappropriate encounters, such as voyeurism or indecent exposure, and instead suppose they have misunderstood the incident. Law enforcement also becomes less likely to get involved in incidents involving gender identity claims. For one thing, a gender identity standard makes it harder to prove that predators intended to commit a crime—not to mention that law enforcement may be reluctant to get involved for fear of being accused of discrimination. While this law poses a risk to all women, those who have been victims of previous sexual assault are particularly vulnerable. Being forced to share intimate spaces with biological males or being exposed to male anatomy can be particularly distressing to assault victims. For example, take the Hope Center, a women’s shelter for victims of domestic violence, sexual abuse, and human trafficking in Anchorage, Alaska. The center is facing a formal complaint under the city’s gender identity policy, similar to the law in Massachusetts, after a biological male who identifies as female attempted to access the center’s overnight facilities. Women fleeing violence and abuse deserve privacy when it comes to showers, changing rooms, and sleeping areas. Overly broad policies like the ones in Anchorage and Massachusetts leave them vulnerable to additional trauma. The best way to protect these women is to ensure that they are granted bodily privacy—something current Massachusetts law entirely disregards. It is worth mentioning that restoring Massachusetts law to an objective biological standard need not preclude solutions for transgender individuals. However, such accommodations should not come at the cost of bodily privacy and safety for people across the board, particularly women and children. Local institutions and authorities should work together to craft reasonable policies that keep everyone safe, rather than statewide, one-size-fits-all policies that leave huge groups of people at risk. Only when we can guarantee the privacy and safety of women and children can we pursue solutions that meet the needs of all citizens."},

Depending on the outcome of races that are still too close to call, the 116th Congress will have anywhere from 109 to 117 women. That is three-and-a-half times as many women as were in the 102nd Congress of 1991-1992. And it’s cause for celebration. But now imagine if all those women were headed to Congress following imposition of a gender quota. Few people would be celebrating women’s successes then. Instead, they would be viewed as “token legislators,” or “Title IX” recipients—incapable of being elected in their own right. Ostensibly pro-women policies might sound good to those who want to impose certain measurable outcomes—such as equal numbers of women in high-power positions or exact parity between all men’s and all women’s wages—but they could instead backfire on women. As it is today, male and female legislators are equal. They receive the exact same salaries, they can introduce and co-sponsor as many bills as they want (and historically, women introduce and co-sponsor more legislation than men), and they can hold committee chairs and leadership positions. And having been elected by a free vote of their constituents—often defeating male candidates—female legislators earn the same respect as men. If Congress were to pass a gender quota law for legislators, as California did for boardrooms of corporations headquartered there, it would demean female legislators instead of applauding their successes. Imagine female lawmakers up against a bunch of male colleagues who resent the leg-up the women got into Congress, or being told by constituents at townhall meetings that they don’t deserve their position because they didn’t actually earn it. That’s what’s happened with the “golden skirt” phenomenon. After Norway and other European countries passed corporate boardroom quotas, women suddenly had a huge advantage over men. But instead of creating a general boost in the ranks for women, boardroom quotas in Norway led companies to all seek after the same small group of eligible women. One such “golden skirt” sat on the boards of as many as 90 companies at the same time. Moreover, boardroom quotas in Norway hurt companies’ performances because they led to younger, less experienced, and less capable boards. And as an Economist article headline declared, “Gender quotas at board level in Europe have done little to boost corporate performance or to help women lower down.” The same would be true for so-called equal pay laws. Except that while quotas would push women into roles they otherwise wouldn’t hold, equal pay laws would prevent women from holding roles they otherwise could have. Forcing companies to maintain gender-based equity in pay would require them to impose one-size-fits-all jobs that actually wouldn’t fit many working women’s needs and desires. Women tend to place more value on nonwage-based job benefits, such as a flexible work schedules, on-site child care, or more generous fringe benefits. But those features wouldn’t show up in employers’ pay records, so they would be unlikely to offer them. Moreover, equal pay for equal work is already the law of the land. And when you take into account the measurable choices men and women make regarding things such as their occupation and hours of work, women are essentially on par with men. (Non-measurable factors, such as flexibility, likely account for the small unexplained gap in pay.) The fact that the number of women in Congress has increased three and a half-fold since 1992 without any legislation addressing the gap shows that women are fully capable, when they choose to, of shattering so-called “glass ceilings” on their own. Let’s hope that the 116th Congress pursues policies that would create equal opportunities for all women and men alike, instead of ones that would benefit only an elite group of women or that would limit women’s access to jobs that meet their individual needs and desires."},

Anderson, Ph.D."], "date": "Nov 26, 2018 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/new-york-times-reveals-painful-truths-about-sex-change-surgery", "takeaways": ["Chu acknowledges that the surgery won’t actually “reassign” sex: “My body will regard the vagina as a wound.\"", "Chu acknowledges that “transitioning” may not make things better and could even make things worse.", "We need to find better, more humane and effective, responses to people who experience dysphoria."], "text": "In Sunday’s New York Times, Andrea Long Chu writes a heartfelt and heartbreaking op-ed on life with gender dysphoria. Titled “My New Vagina Won’t Make Me Happy,” the op-ed reveals painful truths about many transgender lives and inadvertently communicates almost the exact opposite of its intended argument. Next week, Chu will undergo vaginoplasty surgery. Or, as Chu puts it: “Next Thursday, I will get a vagina. The procedure will last around six hours, and I will be in recovery for at least three months.” Will this bring happiness? Probably not, but Chu wants it all the same: “This is what I want, but there is no guarantee it will make me happier. In fact, I don’t expect it to. That shouldn’t disqualify me from getting it.” Chu argues that the simple desire for sex-reassignment surgery should be all that is required for a patient to receive it. No consideration for authentic health and well-being or concern about poor outcomes should prevent a doctor from performing the surgery if a patient wants it. Chu explains: “No amount of pain, anticipated or continuing, justifies its withholding.” This is a rather extreme conclusion. Chu writes: “Surgery’s only prerequisite should be a simple demonstration of want.” This is quite a claim. And we’ll come back to it. But as the op-ed builds to this stark conclusion, Chu reveals many frequently unacknowledged truths about transgender lives—truths that we should attend to. Sex Isn’t ‘Assigned,’ and Surgery Can’t Change It First, Chu acknowledges that the surgery won’t actually “reassign” sex: “My body will regard the vagina as a wound; as a result, it will require regular, painful attention to maintain.” Sex reassignment is quite literally impossible. Surgery can’t actually reassign sex, because sex isn’t “assigned” in the first place. As I point out in “When Harry Became Sally,” sex is a bodily reality—the reality of how an organism is organized with respect to sexual reproduction. That reality isn’t “assigned” at birth or any time after. Sex—maleness or femaleness—is established at a child’s conception, can be ascertained even at the earliest stages of human development by technological means, and can be observed visually well before birth with ultrasound imaging. Cosmetic surgery and cross-sex hormones don’t change biological reality. People who undergo sex-reassignment procedures do not become the opposite sex—they merely masculinize or feminize their outward appearance. Gender Dysphoria Is Deeply Painful Second, Chu acknowledges the deep pain of gender dysphoria, the sense of distress or alienation one feels at one’s bodily sex: ‘Transitioning’ May Not Make Things Better, and Could Make Them Worse Third, Chu acknowledges that “transitioning” may not make things better and could even make things worse. Chu writes: “I feel demonstrably worse since I started on hormones.” And continues: “Like many of my trans friends, I’ve watched my dysphoria balloon since I began transition.” Indeed, as I document in”When Harry Became Sally,” the medical evidence suggests that sex reassignment does not adequately address the psychosocial difficulties faced by people who identify as transgender. Even when the procedures are successful technically and cosmetically, and even in cultures that are relatively “trans-friendly,” transitioners still face poor outcomes. Even the Obama administration admitted that the best studies do not report improvement after reassignment surgery. In August 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid wrote: “[t]he four best designed and conducted studies that assessed quality of life before and after surgery using validated (albeit non-specific) psychometric studies did not demonstrate clinically significant changes or differences in psychometric test results after [gender reassignment surgery].” What does that mean? A population of patients is suffering so much that they would submit to amputations and other radical surgeries, and the best research the Obama administration could find suggests that it brings them no meaningful improvements in their quality of life. Suicide Is a Serious Risk Fourth, Chu acknowledges a struggle with suicide ideation: “I was not suicidal before hormones. Now I often am.” In 2016, the Obama administration acknowledged a similar reality. In a discussion of the largest and most robust study on sex-reassignment, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid pointed out “The study identified increased mortality and psychiatric hospitalization compared to the matched controls. The mortality was primarily due to completed suicides (19.1-fold greater than in control Swedes).” These results are tragic. And they directly contradict the most popular media narratives, as well as many of the snapshot studies that do not track people over time. Indeed, the Obama administration noted that “mortality from this patient population did not become apparent until after 10 years.” So when the media tout studies that only track outcomes for a few years, and claim that reassignment is a stunning success, there are good grounds for skepticism. The Purpose of Medicine Is Healing This brings us back to Chu’s argument that “surgery’s only prerequisite should be a simple demonstration of want.” What should we make of it? Why should a doctor perform surgery when it won’t make the patient happy, it won’t accomplish its intended goal, it won’t improve the underlying condition, it might make the underlying condition worse, and it might increase the likelihood of suicide? Chu wants to turn the profession of medicine on its head, transforming a medical doctor into nothing more than “a highly competent hired syringe,” in the words of Leon Kass. Unfortunately, Chu isn’t alone. Many professionals now view health care—including mental health care—primarily as a means of fulfilling patients’ desires, whatever those are. Kass explains: This vision of medicine and medical professionals gets it wrong. Professionals ought to profess their devotion to the purposes and ideals they serve. That’s what makes them professionals, and not just service providers.Teachers should be devoted to learning, lawyers to justice under law, and physicians to “healing the sick, looking up to health and wholeness.” Healing is “the central core of medicine,” Kass writes—“to heal, to make whole, is the doctor’s primary business.” But Chu’s vision of medicine turns the doctor into someone who merely satisfies desires, even if what is done isn’t good for a patient. Chu writes: Sound medicine isn’t about desire, it’s about healing. To provide the best possible care, serving the patient’s medical interests requires an understanding of human wholeness and well-being. Mental health care must be guided by a sound concept of human flourishing. Our brains and senses are designed to bring us into contact with reality, connecting us with the outside world and with the reality of ourselves. Thoughts and feelings that disguise or distort reality are misguided, and they can cause harm. In “When Harry Became Sally,” I argue that we need to do a better job of helping people who face these struggles. Misrepresentations of My Work Chu also takes issue with me: Of course, I never call people with gender dysphoria crazy. And I explicitly state in the book that I take no position on the technical question of whether someone’s thinking that he or she is the opposite sex is a clinical delusion. That’s why Chu couldn’t quote any portion of my book saying as much. Throughout the book, I point out that the feelings that people who identify as transgender report are real—they really feel a disconnect with their bodily sex—but I also acknowledge the fact that those feelings don’t change bodily reality. I recognize the real distress that gender dysphoria can cause, but never do I call people experiencing it crazy. I repeatedly acknowledge that gender dysphoria is a serious condition, that people who experience a gender identity conflict should be treated with respect and compassion, that we need to find better, more humane and effective, responses to people who experience dysphoria. Nevertheless, Chu claims that I am engaged in “‘compassion-mongering,’ peddling bigotry in the guise of sympathetic concern.” For the record, Chu never contacted me regarding my research or my book. Nor did the Times contact me to verify any of the claims made about me in the op-ed. Indeed, this is the second time the New York Times has published an op-ed with inaccurate criticisms of me and my book. Americans disagree about gender identity and the best approaches to treating gender dysphoria. We need to respect the dignity of people who identify as transgender while also doing everything possible to help people find wholeness and happiness. That will require a better conversation about these issues, which is why I wrote my book. And it’s presumably why Chu wrote this op-ed. Now is not the time for personal attacks and name-calling, but for sober and respectful truth-telling. Chu may regard me as a “bigot,” but I regard Chu as a fellow human being made in the image and likeness of God who is struggling with a painful and dangerous condition. As such, Chu deserves care and support that will bring health and wholeness—not the on-demand delivery of “services” that even Chu acknowledges are unlikely to make life better and may make it very much worse."},

It’s a gender. It makes no more sense being included with LGB than if you were to add ‘female’ in there.”"], "text": "Events at the July 7 Pride in London parade revealed deepening fractures that could lead to a schism in the LGBT community. A group of eight lesbians interrupted the parade to protest the inclusion of transgender individuals in the LGBT community. One protester shouted, “A man who says he’s a lesbian is a rapist,” referring to a man who identifies as a woman. The Daily Wire cited a flyer shared by anti-transgender lesbians that read, “The trans movement is … coercing lesbians to have sex with men. We firmly condemn this vicious form of anti-lesbianism disguised as progress.” The disruption was a demonstration by the “Get the L Out” campaign, which organizers describe as “a group of lesbian and feminist individuals and organizations, opposing the increasingly anti-lesbian and misogynistic LGBT movement and the erasure of lesbians.” The organizers of the Pride in London parade scrambled to issue an official apology, denouncing the protesters’ message in the days following the parade and calling the protest a demonstration of “bigotry, ignorance, and hate.” Adversaries labeled the protesters and others like them TERFs (trans-exclusionary radical feminists), a term the feminists consider a slur. The demonstration produced a large backlash on Twitter: The episode highlights the unrest between the LGB and T parts of the conventional acronym, but the tension is nothing new. Tremors of disunity existed ever since the two parties unified in 1988 and first came to a head in 2007 when LGBs were willing to drop Ts from the Employment Nondiscrimination Act to get it through Congress. The transgender activists’ uproar caused the term “gender identity” to be readmitted to the list of protected categories in the legislation. However, it was only a surface-level remedy; the disunity quietly festered. It resurfaced during the legal battle over students who identify as transgender who want to use sex-specific facilities, such as bathrooms, that were opposite from their biological sex. During the bathroom controversy, some lesbian, feminist, and conservative groups partnered to highlight the many problems in allowing members of the opposite sex into a school bathroom, locker room, dorm room, or other sex-specific facility. The Women’s Liberation Front, a progressive feminist group, and Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal defense group, partnered to file an amicus brief in the court case Gloucester County School Board v. GG, the central case in the bathroom debate here in the United States. In February 2017, The Heritage Foundation held a panel discussion titled Biology Isn’t Bigotry: Why Sex Matters in the Age of Gender Identity. The panel was composed of four women, two of whom supported LGB causes but disagreed with certain aspects of the transgender agenda. One panelist, Miriam Ben Shalom, stated, “Transgender issues are not our [LGB] issues.” Regarding the term “gender identity,” Shalom stated, “Biology isn’t bigotry. Biology is the truth.” One group of LGB members, “Drop the T,” suggested that “the transgender community needs to be disassociated from the larger LGB community.” Among other reasons, the group cites the “vilification” of LGB individuals who disagree with the transgender movement, such as calling them “transphobic bigots,” as one of the primary reasons for their petition to split from the transgender advocates. Another concern for Drop the T is the privacy and safety of women in sex-specific facilities, which would be made accessible to biological males under gender identity policies. The group also references the serious implications of radical gender-affirming therapies for kids, including puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones for children as young as four. LGB groups are not the only ones calling for a split. Metro, a U.K.-based news outlet, published an article in which a transgender individual advocated separating the T. The author argues, “Forms ask you if you’re heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or transgender. But [transgender is] not a sexuality. It’s a gender. It makes no more sense being included with LGB than if you were to add ‘female’ in there.” The author continues, “Sexuality and gender are not the same thing and are independent of one another.” The Independent ran a similar article by another transgender individual who writes, “The simple point that everyone seems to be missing here is that being transgender and being gay are two entirely different things and they should never be confused.” These articles and the protest at the London Pride parade strongly suggest that the alliance between the LGB and T communities is weakening and may even come to an end. Only time will tell."},
{"title": "Hollywood’s One-Sided Narrative on \"Conversion Therapy\"", "author": ["Monica  Burke"], "date": "Nov 21, 2018 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/hollywoods-one-sided-narrative-conversion-therapy", "takeaways": [], "text": "Hollywood is presenting only one side of the debate over counseling for those who experience unwanted same-sex attraction, and it is seeking to silence those who can offer help to the struggling. Recent films like “The Miseducation of Cameron Post” and “Boy Erased”—both based on true stories—tell the stories of individuals who had negative or even abusive experiences in these kinds of therapies. Activist groups like the Human Rights Campaign and GLAAD are pushing these films to argue for so-called “conversion therapy bans” for minors and for adults. However, these kinds of laws fail to take into account important concerns about individual freedom—particularly the freedom of patients to have access to all available information that can help them. Absent from Hollywood’s portrayal of these therapies are the stories of people who actively sought out counseling and had positive experiences. Take Ken Williams. He bravely shared his story with the California state Legislature earlier this year when the state considered an expansive bill that banned “sexual orientation change efforts,” with expansive and often unclear implications for freedom of speech. Williams was attracted to men for most of his life, but wanted to change. So he found a therapist and a support group who helped him to pursue that. “Some of us experienced the change we were looking for in that group, but not everyone did,” he shared. “Despite years of homosexual identity and behavior, my sexual desires did change. I am no longer sexually attracted to men,” he said. Williams soon met a girl he was attracted to, and they married in 2006. “Not everyone who finds themselves with same-sex desires [wants] to pursue that,” he said. “So I am trying to understand why people would want to take away the rights of my [group], which is people finding themselves with desires they would like to see changed.” The California bill would have defined sexual orientation change efforts as “any practices that seek to change an individual’s sexual orientation. This includes efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions, or to eliminate or reduce sexual romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.” Such broad terminology that includes not only attractions, but actions, has drastic implications for individual freedom. Such counseling bans completely dismiss the needs of individuals who genuinely desire to pursue counseling, sometimes because of inner conflicts. It also limits the speech of counselors or ministries that support individuals in their personal choice not to act on these desires. This bill, and others like it, would have granted state government the power to punish counselors or religious leaders acting as licensed counselors who counsel patients who do not wish to act upon their same-sex attraction for legitimate personal reasons—for example, someone who wants to live by their religion’s teachings on sexuality or to remain faithful to their spouse and children. Ultimately, the representative who introduced this bill into the California Legislature pulled it due to its overly broad language and sweeping implications. But this will unlikely be the last time state lawmakers consider an outright ban on counseling that they do not consider sufficiently LGBT-affirming. Fifteen states plus D.C. already have such counseling bans for youth in place, and activists are using these latest films to call for even more bans. No one is in favor of allowing any kind of abuse to masquerade as “therapy.” But counseling bans are the wrong tool for addressing actual cases of abuse. Silencing speech only limits the options of people who wish to live consistent with what they believe about sexuality. Banning one side’s speech is not the solution. Unfortunately, the incomplete narrative offered by Hollywood only buttresses these efforts. We should take into account the legitimate needs of those who wish to pursue therapy that supports their lifestyle choices, even if they don’t conform to the latest cultural trends. Only then will our public policy simultaneously protect and respect the freedom of everyone."},
{"title": "This Teacher Was Fired for \"Misgendering\" a Student. Who Could Be Next?", "author": ["Monica  Burke"], "date": "Dec 11, 2018 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/teacher-was-fired-misgendering-student-who-could-be-next", "takeaways": [], "text": "Last week, a Virginia school board voted unanimously to fire a teacher after he refused to comply with administrators’ orders to use a female student’s preferred masculine pronouns. The student “transitioned” over the summer and began identifying as a man. This latest casualty in the culture wars raises the obvious question: Who could be next? Peter Vlaming went to great lengths to accommodate the student without violating his Christian faith. He used the student’s new name to avoid upsetting the student, but refrained from using pronouns altogether in the student’s presence to avoid speaking against his belief that God created human beings male and female. “I’m happy to avoid female pronouns not to offend because I’m not here to provoke,” Vlaming told the press, “but I can’t refer to a female as a male, and a male as a female in good conscience and faith.” However, this was not enough to satisfy the student’s family or the board. “I can’t think of a worse way to treat a child than what was happening,” said the principal, who had ordered the teacher to use the student’s preferred pronouns against his beliefs. This incident does not bode well for future conflicts over transgender policies. As more of these conflicts arise in schools, hospitals, shelters, and businesses, America must allow its citizens to think about and debate these issues freely. No one should fear losing their job because they believe that men and women are biological realities that are not interchangeable. Unfortunately, government coercion as a weapon of the culture wars is now spreading across the professions. First, there were cases in the wedding industry where the government tried to force people to violate their belief that marriage is between a man and a woman—florists, bakers, photographers, wedding venues, and so forth. Then those lawsuits spread to even more industries—videography, web design, calligraphy studios, and public service. Now, the government is beginning to penalize people who hold that there are two biological sexes. For example, a Catholic hospital was sued for refusing to remove a biological female’s healthy uterus to pursue gender transition. Meanwhile, two parents lost custody of their teenage daughter for refusing to allow their child to take testosterone and identify as a boy. This could be just the beginning. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi recently announced that the Equality Act will be a top Democratic priority in 2019. The bill would impose controversial transgender policies on the nationby elevating “gender identity” to protected status in federal anti-discrimination law. This would have drastic implications for average Americans. It would open up sex-specific facilities like bathrooms, locker rooms, and shelters to members of the opposite biological sex. It would allow biological males to compete on women’s sports teams. It would force health care providers and insurance companies to provide and pay for radical transgender therapies. In brief, stories like Vlaming’s would become the new normal. This kind of sweeping, coercive policy is not the answer to current debates about gender identity. Americans must remain free to discuss these policies in a respectful manner—which is why the firing of Vlaming is so disturbing. Instead of allowing the parties involved to find a workable compromise, the school board not only picked sides, it silenced one side. This is an extremely disturbing precedent. Sadly, while Vlaming was willing to work to make the student a cherished member of the community, the school board was not willing to work to make the teacher a cherished member as well. Instead of pursuing a solution that would respect everyone—teacher and student alike—the school board refused to respect Vlaming’s beliefs and terminated him. Speaking and acting according to one’s conscience should not be a fireable offense. When authorities try to force people to act against their beliefs, it is a blatant abuse of power—one that can easily backfire when political power changes hands. That is why everyone should be concerned about these emerging challenges to freedom of conscience. Now that Vlaming has lost his job, who could be next? The honest answer is that someday, it may well be you."},

Apparently the Times is unaware discrimination occurs daily in recruiting stations across the United States. It’s required by law. Federal law says the armed services must assure that all entrants be “qualified, effective, and able-bodied.” Lawful, justifiable discrimination ensures that the U.S. military and the service members who compose it, are able to succeed anywhere, anytime. Discriminating military entrance criteria have existed since the birth of an American army. In the Civil War, recruits who lacked four front teeth were disqualified because they could not tear open gunpowder packages. The Pentagon transgender policy, as announced last week, is wholly consistent with a long history of evidence-based U.S. military entrance criteria. First, for those who volunteer to serve in the military, thanks are in order. Less than 1 percent of the U.S. population volunteer to join the military, so these patriots deserve the nation’s gratitude for their willingness to serve. But volunteers must meet certain standards in order to be accepted into service. History of severe mental depression? Disqualifying. History of asthma? Disqualifying. Past suicide attempts? Disqualifying. You get the picture. These standards are not arbitrary. On the contrary, the disqualifying conditions have been adjusted and modified over time, based on scrupulously maintained medical data. The goal is to ensure that individuals who join the military can meet the rigorous training requirements and capably serve in the most austere and challenging combat environments without risk to either themselves or their units. The new policy treats the transgender population no more “inhumanely” than existing entrance criteria treat asthmatics. The new policy makes a careful and medically-supported distinctionbetween persons who are transgender and those who suffer from gender dysphoria. The former are people whose gender identity differs from their biological sex. The latter is a mental condition defined in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders that afflicts some transgender individuals. People with gender dysphoria experience significant mental anxiety and distress because their gender identity differs from their biological sex. Significantly, the new policy allows transgender individuals not experiencing gender dysphoria to enlist and serve in the military. This is consistent with the bedrock principle of the Department of Defense that “any eligible individual who can meet the high standards for military service without special accommodation should be permitted to serve.” It also provides the Pentagon with more options to meet its ever-more challenging mission to recruit sufficient numbers of service members. But for those people experiencing gender dysphoria, the policy returns to the previous, pre-2016 entrance standards, disqualifying them from both entry and retention in the military. The comprehensive study accompanying the policy amply justifies why this is appropriate. The Pentagon’s own medical data reflect that, compared to service members as a whole, individuals with gender dysphoria are eight times more likely to attempt suicide and nine times more likely to have mental health encounters. Military life and deployments in particular place exceptional stress on service members; suicide rates among military members already exceed those of the U.S. population. It would be both reckless and detrimental to unit readiness to allow individuals already pre-disposed to mental distress — in this case, those with gender dysphoria — to serve in the military. Some assert that gender dysphoria is treatable, including with transition surgery and hormones. But as the study accompanying the new policy points out, the available medical data prove that even with often lengthy and costly treatment, individuals who receive gender dysphoria treatment still experience suicide rates far higher than the general population’s. There is also the issue of medical costs and time lost due to medical treatments. As a matter of existing policy, the military does not admit individuals who will likely need extensive medical treatment. Once again, the new policy is consistent with that precedent. In uncharacteristically blunt language, Defense Secretary James Mattis’ study found serious fault with a Rand Corporation study that had created the intellectual underpinning of the Obama administration’s transgender policy. The Pentagon has since determined that the Rand study “failed to analyze the impact at the micro level of allowing gender transition by individuals with gender dysphoria.” Moreover, it “did not meaningfully address the significant mental health problems that accompany dysphoria,” and “did not examine the potential impact on unit readiness, perceptions of fairness and equity, personnel safety, and reasonable expectations of privacy at the unit.” How this study could have overlooked such fundamental aspects of a significant policy change is unclear. What is clear is that Secretary Mattis and the Pentagon have produced a thoughtful, nuanced policy supported by clear evidence and fact. This policy strikes the correct balance between allowing qualified volunteers to serve and preventing those whose service might harm either themselves or compromise the effectiveness of the U.S. military."},
{"title": "The Supreme Court's \"Gay Cake\" Case Matters to All Americans", "author": ["Emilie  Kao"], "date": "Feb 5, 2018 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/courts/commentary/the-supreme-courts-gay-cake-case-matters-all-americans", "takeaways": ["The Supreme Court will decide how much power a government can exercise to force a person to create art that violates their conscience.", "It was not about hostility to sexual orientation.", "America’s founders believed in the simple principle that people of all faiths should be able to think, speak, and work without government oppression."], "text": "On Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a landmark religious liberty and free speech case, Masterpiece Cakeshop Ltd. v. Colorado Anti-Discrimination Commission. This case is important to all Americans, not just to Jack Phillips, the Colorado cake artist and owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop, who petitioned the Court for a hearing. The Supreme Court will decide how much power a government can exercise to force a person to create art that violates their conscience. Jack Phillips is a Christian who believes that marriage is the union of one man and woman so designing a custom cake for a same-sex wedding would violate his conscience. But, what’s at stake in this case reaches far beyond the issue of marriage. It will affect Americans of many beliefs and vocations for generations to come. At stake is whether the First Amendment to the Constitution protects all Americans at all times. Colorado alleges that Jack Phillips discriminated against the two men because of their sexual orientation. In the state’s view, support for traditional marriage equates with discrimination. However, when the Supreme Court redefined marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote that support for traditional marriage is based on “decent and honorable” premises and held “in good faith by reasonable and sincere people here and throughout the world.” He also said that the Supreme Court’s decision did not disparage people who support traditional marriage. That’s precisely why Colorado’s decision is so wrong. Jack Phillips welcomes and serves everyone, of all sexual orientations, selling them coffee and off-the-shelf baked goods. On occasion, he has to decline a custom cake order because it expresses an idea that violates his conscience. He has declined requests for Halloween and divorce cakes, and he has declined to create anti-gay messages. The Satanic Temple recently asked him to create a cake for Satan’s birthday; he declined that order, too. When he politely told the gay couple he couldn’t design a custom wedding cake for them, it was for the same reason that he had said no to the other requests: it would have violated his conscience. It was not about hostility to sexual orientation. Colorado rightfully recognizes and respects the right of African-American cake artists to say no to requests for cakes expressing the racist ideals of the Aryan Nations Church. Colorado should also demonstrate this kind of respect for Jack Phillips’ First Amendment freedoms. Some may think that Jack’s case affects only those in the wedding industry. But, the nation’s top fire administrator Kelvin Cochran, the former CEO of Mozilla Brendan Eich, and former Air Force Colonel Leland Bohannon all lost their jobs or opportunities to advance because of hostility toward their belief in traditional marriage. New categories based on sexual orientation and gender identity have been added to anti-discrimination laws in 21 other states and Washington, D.C. And states are using them to punish many people in many professions for their beliefs about marriage, the family, and biological sex: All Americans should be concerned when people are no longer able to do their jobs because of their religious or moral beliefs about marriage, family, and sex differences. There is no need for states to impose draconian punishments on people like Jack Phillips, because the handful of lawsuits across the country have been over disagreements about marriage, not because people are being turned away from restaurants or hotels simply because they are gay. The same-sex couple that went to Jack Phillips’ shop was inundated with free offers to make wedding cakes. They opted for one with rainbow-colored filling, highlighting how a cake can express a clear message and idea. But the couple still filed a complaint against Jack Phillips. As a result, he was targeted with angry, obscene phone calls and death threats. Even Americans who support same-sex marriage should also care about this case—and support victory for Jack Phillips. Matt and T.J. are two gay men who support Jack’s religious rights fight. Some may think that surrendering power to the state to punish someone like Jack will never affect them. But, this is short-sighted. Today’s orthodoxies can easily become tomorrow’s heresies. This is exactly what happened to marriage. What was our country’s cultural orthodoxy yesterday has become cultural heresy. The winds of culture are always shifting, but the Constitution’s protections of our rights must remain firm. Turning a blind eye when the government takes away a neighbor’s freedom is never the end of the story. If the government can become so powerful that it can override the will of some people to think, speak, and work according to their beliefs, then civil society has become so feeble that freedom depends on being on the “right side” of government. This only works until you’re on the “wrong side.” Whatever one believes about marriage, surrendering control to the government to enforce its preferred beliefs on other citizens is a betrayal of freedom. Jack Phillips and others like him could lose their freedom to create art, run businesses, and even retire with their life savings simply because they won’t bargain away their belief that marriage is between one man and one woman. America’s founders believed in the simple principle that people of all faiths should be able to think, speak, and work without government oppression. This idea has endured for two and a half centuries and enabled people of vastly different religious beliefs to flourish here. Now, Jack Phillips is going to the Supreme Court to ensure that the First Amendment will continue to protect all Americans at all times."},
{"title": "Transgender Ideology Is Riddled With Contradictions. Here Are the Big Ones.", "author": ["Ryan T. Anderson, Ph.D."], "date": "Feb 9, 2018 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/transgender-ideology-riddled-contradictions-here-are-the-big-ones", "takeaways": [], "text": "People say that we live in a postmodern age that has rejected metaphysics. That’s not quite true. We live in a postmodern age that promotes an alternative metaphysics. As I explain in “When Harry Became Sally,” at the heart of the transgender moment are radical ideas about the human person—in particular, that people are what they claim to be, regardless of contrary evidence. A transgender boy is a boy, not merely a girl who identifies as a boy. It’s understandable why activists make these claims. An argument about transgender identities will be much more persuasive if it concerns who someone is, not merely how someone identifies. And so the rhetoric of the transgender moment drips with ontological assertions: People are the gender they prefer to be. That’s the claim. Transgender activists don’t admit that this is a metaphysical claim. They don’t want to have the debate on the level of philosophy, so they dress it up as a scientific and medical claim. And they’ve co-opted many professional associations for their cause. Thus the American Psychological Association, in a pamphlet titled “Answers to Your Questions about Transgender People, Gender Identity, and Gender Expression,” tells us, “Transgender is an umbrella term for persons whose gender identity, gender expression, or behavior does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth.” Notice the politicized language: A person’s sex is “assigned at birth.” Back in 2005, even the Human Rights Campaign referred instead to “birth sex” and “physical sex.” The phrase “sex assigned at birth” is now favored because it makes room for “gender identity” as the real basis of a person’s sex. In an expert declaration to a federal district court in North Carolina concerning H.B. 2, Dr. Deanna Adkins stated, “From a medical perspective, the appropriate determinant of sex is gender identity.” Adkins is a professor at Duke University School of Medicine and the director of the Duke Center for Child and Adolescent Gender Care (which opened in 2015). Adkins argues that gender identity is not only the preferred basis for determining sex, but “the only medically supported determinant of sex.” Every other method is bad science, she claims: “It is counter to medical science to use chromosomes, hormones, internal reproductive organs, external genitalia, or secondary sex characteristics to override gender identity for purposes of classifying someone as male or female.” This is a remarkable claim, not least because the argument recently was that gender is only a social construct, while sex is a biological reality. Now, activists claim that gender identity is destiny, while biological sex is the social construct. Adkins doesn’t say if she would apply this rule to all mammalian species. But why should sex be determined differently in humans than in other mammals? And if medical science holds that gender identity determines sex in humans, what does this mean for the use of medicinal agents that have different effects on males and females? Does the proper dosage of medicine depend on the patient’s sex or gender identity? But what exactly is this “gender identity” that is supposed to be the true medical determinant of sex? Adkins defines it as “a person’s inner sense of belonging to a particular gender, such as male or female.” Note that little phrase “such as,” implying that the options are not necessarily limited to male or female. Other activists are more forthcoming in admitting that gender identity need not be restricted to the binary choice of male or female, but can include both or neither. The American Psychological Association, for example, defines “gender identity” as “a person’s internal sense of being male, female, or something else.” Adkins asserts that being transgender is not a mental disorder, but simply “a normal developmental variation.” And she claims, further, that medical and mental health professionals who specialize in the treatment of gender dysphoria are in agreement with this view. Transgender Catechism These notions about sex and gender are now being taught to young children. Activists have created child-friendly graphics for this purpose, such as the “Genderbread Person.” The Genderbread Person teaches that when it comes to sexuality and gender, people have five different characteristics, each of them falling along a spectrum. There’s “gender identity,” which is “how you, in your head, define your gender, based on how much you align (or don’t align) with what you understand to be the options for gender.” The graphic lists “4 (of infinite)” possibilities for gender identity: “woman-ness,” “man-ness,” “two-spirit,” or “genderqueer.” The second characteristic is “gender expression,” which is “the way you present gender, through your actions, dress, and demeanor.” In addition to “feminine” or “masculine,” the options are “butch,” “femme,” “androgynous,” or “gender neutral.” Third is “biological sex,” defined as “the physical sex characteristics you’re born with and develop, including genitalia, body shape, voice pitch, body hair, hormones, chromosomes, etc.” The final two characteristics concern sexual orientation: “sexually attracted to” and “romantically attracted to.” The options include “Women/Females/Femininity” and “Men/Males/Masculinity.” Which seems rather binary. The Genderbread Person tries to localize these five characteristics on the body: gender identity in the brain, sexual and romantic attraction in the heart, biological sex in the pelvis, and gender expression everywhere. The Genderbread Person espouses the latest iteration of transgender ideology. (Photo: Sam Killerman/It’s Prounounced Metrosexual) The Genderbread Person presented here is version 3.3, incorporating adjustments made in response to criticism of earlier versions. But even this one violates current dogma. Some activists have complained that the Genderbread Person looks overly male. A more serious fault in the eyes of many activists is the use of the term “biological sex.” Time magazine drew criticism for the same transgression in 2014 after publishing a profile of Laverne Cox, the “first out trans person” to be featured on the cover. At least the folks at Time got credit for trying to be “good allies, explaining what many see as a complicated issue,” wrote Mey Rude in an article titled “It’s Time for People to Stop Using the Social Construct of ‘Biological Sex’ to Defend Their Transmisogyny.” (It’s hard to keep up with the transgender moment.) But Time was judged guilty of using “a simplistic and outdated understanding of biology to perpetuate some very dangerous ideas about trans women,” and failing to acknowledge that biological sex “isn’t something we’re actually born with, it’s something that doctors or our parents assign us at birth.” Today, transgender “allies” in good standing don’t use the Genderbread Person in their classrooms, but opt for the “Gender Unicorn,” which was created by Trans Student Educational Resources. It has a body shape that doesn’t appear either male or female, and instead of a “biological sex” it has a “sex assigned at birth.” Those are the significant changes to the Genderbread Person, and they were made so that the new graphic would “more accurately portray the distinction between gender, sex assigned at birth, and sexuality.” According to Trans Student Education Resources, “Biological sex is an ambiguous word that has no scale and no meaning besides that it is related to some sex characteristics. It is also harmful to trans people. Instead, we prefer ‘sex assigned at birth’ which provides a more accurate description of what biological sex may be trying to communicate.” The Gender Unicorn is the graphic that children are likely to encounter in school. These are the dogmas they are likely to be catechized to profess. The Gender Unicorn is used to avoid using a male or female body as default. (Photo: Landyn Pan and Anna Moore/Trans Student Educational Resources) While activists claim that the possibilities for gender identity are rather expansive—man, woman, both, neither—they also insist that gender identity is innate, or established at a very young age, and thereafter immutable. Dr. George Brown, a professor of psychiatry and a three-time board member of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, stated in his declaration to the federal court in North Carolina that gender identity “is usually established early in life, by the age of 2 to 3 years old.” Addressing the same court, Adkins asserted that “evidence strongly suggests that gender identity is innate or fixed at a young age and that gender identity has a strong biological basis.” (At no point in her expert declaration did she cite any sources for any of her claims.) Transgender Contradictions If the claims presented in this essay strike you as confusing, you’re not alone. The thinking of transgender activists is inherently confused and filled with internal contradictions. Activists never acknowledge those contradictions. Instead, they opportunistically rely on whichever claim is useful at any given moment. Here I’m talking about transgender activists. Most people who suffer from gender dysphoria are not activists, and many of them reject the activists’ claims. Many of them may be regarded as victims of the activists, as I show in my book. Many of those who feel distress over their bodily sex know that they aren’t really the opposite sex, and do not wish to “transition.” They wish to receive help in coming to identify with and accept their bodily self. They don’t think their feelings of gender dysphoria define reality. But transgender activists do. Regardless of whether they identify as “cisgender” or “transgender,” the activists promote a highly subjective and incoherent worldview. On the one hand, they claim that the real self is something other than the physical body, in a new form of Gnostic dualism, yet at the same time they embrace a materialist philosophy in which only the material world exists. They say that gender is purely a social construct, while asserting that a person can be “trapped” in the wrong gender. They say there are no meaningful differences between man and woman, yet they rely on rigid sex stereotypes to argue that “gender identity” is real, while human embodiment is not. They claim that truth is whatever a person says it is, yet they believe there’s a real self to be discovered inside that person. They promote a radical expressive individualism in which people are free to do whatever they want and define the truth however they wish, yet they try ruthlessly to enforce acceptance of transgender ideology. It’s hard to see how these contradictory positions can be combined. If you pull too hard on any one thread of transgender ideology, the whole tapestry comes unraveled. But here are some questions we can pose: If gender is a social construct, how can gender identity be innate and immutable? How can one’s identity with respect to a social construct be determined by biology in the womb? How can one’s identity be unchangeable (immutable) with respect to an ever-changing social construct? And if gender identity is innate, how can it be “fluid”? The challenge for activists is to offer a plausible definition of gender and gender identity that is independent of bodily sex. Is there a gender binary or not? Somehow, it both does and does not exist, according to transgender activists. If the categories of “man” and “woman” are objective enough that people can identify as, and be, men and women, how can gender also be a spectrum, where people can identify as, and be, both, or neither, or somewhere in between? What does it even mean to have an internal sense of gender? What does gender feel like? What meaning can we give to the concept of sex or gender—and thus what internal “sense” can we have of gender—apart from having a body of a particular sex? Apart from having a male body, what does it “feel like” to be a man? Apart from having a female body, what does it “feel like” to be a woman? What does it feel like to be both a man and a woman, or to be neither? The challenge for the transgender activist is to explain what these feelings are like, and how someone could know if he or she “feels like” the opposite sex, or neither, or both. Even if trans activists could answer these questions about feelings, that still wouldn’t address the matter of reality. Why should feeling like a man—whatever that means—make someone a man? Why do our feelings determine reality on the question of sex, but on little else? Our feelings don’t determine our age or our height. And few people buy into Rachel Dolezal’s claim to identify as a black woman, since she is clearly not. If those who identify as transgender are the sex with which they identify, why doesn’t that apply to other attributes or categories of being? What about people who identify as animals, or able-bodied people who identify as disabled? Do all of these self-professed identities determine reality? If not, why not? And should these people receive medical treatment to transform their bodies to accord with their minds? Why accept transgender “reality,” but not trans-racial, trans-species, and trans-abled reality? The challenge for activists is to explain why a person’s “real” sex is determined by an inner “gender identity,” but age and height and race and species are not determined by an inner sense of identity. Of course, a transgender activist could reply that an “identity” is, by definition, just an inner sense of self. But if that’s the case, gender identity is merely a disclosure of how one feels. Saying that someone is transgender, then, says only that the person has feelings that he or she is the opposite sex. Gender identity, so understood, has no bearing at all on the meaning of “sex” or anything else. But transgender activists claim that a person’s self-professed “gender identity” is that person’s “sex.” The challenge for activists is to explain why the mere feeling of being male or female (or both or neither) makes someone male or female (or both or neither). Gender identity can sound a lot like religious identity, which is determined by beliefs. But those beliefs don’t determine reality. Someone who identifies as a Christian believes that Jesus is the Christ. Someone who identifies as a Muslim believes that Muhammad is the final prophet. But Jesus either is or is not the Christ, and Muhammad either is or is not the final prophet, regardless of what anyone happens to believe. So, too, a person either is or is not a man, regardless of what anyone—including that person—happens to believe. The challenge for transgender activists is to present an argument for why transgender beliefs determine reality. Determining reality is the heart of the matter, and here too we find contradictions. On the one hand, transgender activists want the authority of science as they make metaphysical claims, saying that science reveals gender identity to be innate and unchanging. On the other hand, they deny that biology is destiny, insisting that people are free to be who they want to be. Which is it? Is our gender identity biologically determined and immutable, or self-created and changeable? If the former, how do we account for people whose gender identity changes over time? Do these people have the wrong sense of gender at some time or other? And if gender identity is self-created, why must other people accept it as reality? If we should be free to choose our own gender reality, why can some people impose their idea of reality on others just because they identify as transgender? The challenge for the transgender activist is to articulate some conception of truth as the basis for how we understand the common good and how society should be ordered. As I document in depth in “When Harry Became Sally,” the claims of transgender activists are confusing because they are philosophically incoherent. Activists rely on contradictory claims as needed to advance their position, but their ideology keeps evolving, so that even allies and LGBT organizations can get left behind as “progress” marches on. At the core of the ideology is the radical claim that feelings determine reality. From this idea come extreme demands for society to play along with subjective reality claims. Trans ideologues ignore contrary evidence and competing interests, they disparage alternative practices, and they aim to muffle skeptical voices and shut down any disagreement. The movement has to keep patching and shoring up its beliefs, policing the faithful, coercing the heretics, and punishing apostates, because as soon as its furious efforts flag for a moment or someone successfully stands up to it, the whole charade is exposed. That’s what happens when your dogmas are so contrary to obvious, basic, everyday truths. A transgender future is not the “right side of history,” yet activists have convinced the most powerful sectors of our society to acquiesce to their demands. While the claims they make are manifestly false, it will take real work to prevent the spread of these harmful ideas."},

Without commenting on the specifics of this case just outside Cincinnati, Americans can expect to see more cases like it as government officials side with transgender activists to promote a radical view of the human person and endorse entirely experimental medical procedures. At stake are not only parental rights, but the well-being of children who suffer from gender dysphoria. Here’s what you need to know. Transgender activists maintain that when a child identifies as the opposite sex in a manner that is “consistent, persistent, and insistent,” the appropriate response is to support that identification. This requires a four-part protocol, as I painstakingly detail in my new book, “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment”: First, a social transition: giving the child a new wardrobe, a new name, new pronouns, and generally treating the child as if he or she were the opposite sex. Second, a child approaching puberty will be placed on puberty blockers to prevent the normal process of maturation and development. This means there will be no progression of the pubertal stage, and a regression of sex characteristics that have already developed. Puberty-blocking drugs are not FDA approved for gender dysphoria, but physicians use them off-label for this purpose. Third, around age 16, comes the administration of cross-sex hormones: Boys will be given feminizing hormones such as estrogen, and girls will be given masculinizing hormones such as androgens (testosterone). The purpose is to mimic the process of puberty that would occur in the opposite sex. For girls, testosterone treatment leads to “a low voice, facial and body hair growth, and a more masculine body shape,” along with enlargement of the clitoris and atrophying of the breast tissue. For boys, estrogen treatment results in development of breasts and a body shape with a female appearance. These patients will be prescribed cross-sex hormones throughout their lives. Finally, at age 18, these individuals may undergo sex-reassignment surgery: amputation of primary and secondary sex characteristics and plastic surgery to create new sex characteristics. To summarize these procedures (described in detail in my book “When Harry Became Sally”): Male-to-female surgery involves removing the testes and constructing “female-looking external genitals.” It may include breast enlargement if estrogen therapy has not produced satisfactory growth of breasts. Female-to-male surgery often begins with mastectomy. The uterus and ovaries are often removed as well. Some patients will undergo phalloplasty, the surgical construction of a penis, but many do not because the results are variable in quality and functionality. This four-stage course of treatment is the current standard of care promoted by transgender activists. But the ages for each phase to commence are getting lower. In July 2016, The Guardian reported that “a doctor in Wales is prescribing cross-sex hormones to children as young as 12 who say they want to change sex, arguing that if they are confident of their gender identity they should not have to wait until 16 to get the treatment.” No laws in the United States prohibit the use of puberty blockers or cross-sex hormones for children, or regulate the age at which they may be administered. Activists claim that the effects of blocking puberty with drugs are fully reversible. This turns things upside down, for virtually every part of the body undergoes significant development in sex-specific ways during puberty, and going through the process at age 18 can’t reverse 10 years of blocking it. The use of puberty-blocking drugs to treat children with gender dysphoria is entirely experimental, as there are no long-term studies on the consequences of interfering with biological development. Activists claim that blocking puberty allows children “more time to explore their gender identity, without the distress of the developing secondary sex characteristics,” as the Dutch doctors who pioneered this treatment put it. Another Perspective This is an odd argument, write three American researchers, all physicians. “It presumes that natural sex characteristics interfere with the ‘exploration’ of gender identity,” Drs. Paul Hruz, Lawrence Mayer, and Paul McHugh note, “when one would expect that the development of natural sex characteristics might contribute to the natural consolidation of one’s gender identity.” The rush of sex hormones and the bodily development that happens during puberty may be the very things that help an adolescent come to identify with his or her biological sex. Puberty blockers interfere with this process. Normally, 80 to 95 percent of children will naturally grow out of any gender-identity conflicted stage. But every one of the children placed on puberty blockers in the Dutch clinic persisted in a transgender identity, and they generally went on to begin cross-sex hormone treatment at around age 16. Perhaps the Dutch doctors correctly identified the kids who naturally would persist in a transgender identity, but it’s more likely that the puberty blockers reinforced their cross-gender identification, making them more committed to taking further steps in sex reassignment. Contrary to the claims of activists, sex isn’t “assigned” at birth—and that’s why it can’t be “reassigned.” As I explain in “When Harry Became Sally,” sex is a bodily reality that can be recognized well before birth with ultrasound imaging. The sex of an organism is defined and identified by its organization for sexual reproduction. Modern science shows that this organization begins with our DNA and development in the womb, and that sex differences manifest themselves in many bodily systems and organs, all the way down to the molecular level. Secondary differences between the two sexes—attributes that may be visibly altered by hormone treatment and surgery—are not what make us male or female. As a result, cosmetic surgery and cross-sex hormones don’t change the deeper biological reality. People who undergo sex-reassignment procedures do not become the opposite sex, they merely masculinize or feminize their outward appearance. As the philosopher Robert P. George puts it, “Changing sexes is a metaphysical impossibility because it is a biological impossibility.” What the Evidence Shows Sadly, just as “sex reassignment” fails to reassign sex biologically, it also fails to bring wholeness psychologically. The medical evidence suggests that it does not adequately address the mental health problems suffered by those who identify as transgender. Even when the procedures are successful technically and cosmetically, and even in cultures that are relatively “trans-friendly,” people still face poor psychological outcomes. Notwithstanding the media hype over supposed differences in brain structure, no solid scientific evidence exists that transgender identities are innate or biologically determined, and some evidence shows that other factors are most likely involved. But in truth, very little is understood about the causes of discordant gender identities. Starting a young child on a process of “social transitioning” followed by puberty-blocking drugs was virtually unthinkable not long ago, and the treatment is still experimental. Unfortunately, many activists have given up on caution, let alone skepticism, about drastic treatments. A more cautious therapeutic approach begins by acknowledging that the vast majority of children with gender dysphoria will grow out of it naturally. An effective therapy looks into the reasons for the child’s mistaken beliefs about gender, and addresses the problems that the child believes will be solved if the body is altered. As I document in “When Harry Became Sally,” mental health professionals liken gender dysphoria to other dysphorias, or serious discomfort with one’s body, such as anorexia, body dysmorphic disorder, and body integrity identity disorder. All of these involve false assumptions or feelings that solidify into mistaken beliefs about the self. McHugh finds that other psychosocial issues usually lie beneath the false assumptions. Children with gender dysphoria may have  anxieties about “the prospects, expectations, and roles that they sense are attached to their given sex.” Much like patients with anorexia nervosa, these children mistakenly believe that a drastic change of their bodies will solve or minimize their psychosocial problems. But adjusting the body through hormones and surgery doesn’t fix the real problem, any more than liposuction cures anorexia nervosa. A Different Message An effective treatment strategy would “strive to correct the false, problematic nature of the assumption and to resolve the psychosocial conflicts provoking it,” McHugh says. In the case of gender dysphoria, unfortunately, the mistaken belief is often encouraged by school counselors who, “rather like cult leaders, may encourage these young people to distance themselves from their families and offer advice on rebutting arguments against having transgender surgery.” What these young people need, McHugh advises, is to be removed from this “suggestive environment” and be presented with a different message. The proliferation of gender clinics in America and gender identity programs in the schools makes it less likely that children will get the help they need to work out their issues. Instead, these children find “gender counselors” who encourage them to maintain their false assumptions. This is contrary to standard medical and psychological practice, as McHugh, Hruz, and Mayer emphasize. Normally, a child is not encouraged to persist in a belief that is discordant with reality. A traditional form of treatment for gender dysphoria would “work with and not against the facts of science and the predictable rhythms of children’s psycho-sexual development.” A prudent and natural course of treatment would enable children to “reconcile their subjective gender identity with their objective biological sex,” avoiding harmful or irreversible interventions. The most helpful therapies do not try to remake the body to conform with thoughts and feelings—which is impossible—but rather to help people find healthy ways to manage this tension and move toward accepting the reality of their bodily selves. This therapeutic approach rests on a sound understanding of physical and mental health, and of medicine as a practice aimed at restoring healthy functioning, not simply satisfying the desires of patients. Biology isn’t bigotry. And as I explain in “When Harry Became Sally,” there are human costs to getting human nature wrong."},

That’s the argument activists made last week when the Department of Education (DOE) announced that it would begin enforcing Title IX the way the federal government always had, up until the second term of the Obama administration. That’s when the Obama DOE announced that the word “sex” now meant “gender identity” — and ordered schools to open up their bathrooms, locker rooms, showers, and dorms accordingly. It’s understandable that many ordinary Americans recoiled at this transgender mandate. Most Americans — including those who identify as transgender — aren’t activists and want to find ways to peacefully coexist. Most can understand why a man who identifies as a woman doesn’t want to be forced into the men’s room but also understand why women don’t want a man in the ladies’ room. These concerns are even more heightened when dealing with students. New transgender policies raise five distinct areas of concern — privacy, safety, equality, liberty, and ideology — and the Trump administration is right to reject the radical Obama policies in favor of letting local officials work to find reasonable compromises. It shouldn’t be hard to see the privacy concerns that arise when men who identify as women can enter female-only spaces. When changing for gym class, most high-school girls don’t want to see or be seen by boys who identify as girls. The reason we have separate facilities in the first place is not because of “gender identity” but because of the bodily differences between males and females. This privacy concern is particularly acute for victims of sexual assault, who testify that seeing naked male bodies can function as a trigger. Preventing sexual assault is another major area of concern. Public-safety experts explain that predators abuse gender-identity policies to gain access to victims. The concern is not that people who identify as transgender will victimize women but that perverts will use such policies to do so. Indeed, after Target changed its policies to open bathrooms and fitting rooms to people of both sexes, men disguised as women were caught doing just that. Activists promote gender-identity policies in the name of equality, but isn’t it a violation of equality when biological males compete against females in sports and other arenas where sex differences are relevant? Already a high-school girl has lost a state track championship to a boy who was allowed to compete against girls. Activists also promote gender-identity policies in the name of liberty, but isn’t it a violation of liberty to force people to speak or act in ways contrary to their best judgment and deeply held beliefs? In New York City, you can be fined up to a quarter-million dollars for “misgendering” someone. Catholic hospitals are being sued for declining to perform sex-reassignment surgeries. And in its last year, the Obama administration issued a mandate forcing health-care plans to cover sex-reassignment procedures and forcing qualified physicians to perform them. While the mandate doesn’t require that all physicians perform transitions, a surgeon who performs hysterectomies for cancer, for example, would be required to also perform them for sex-reassignment purposes; an endocrinologist who administers testosterone for men with low testosterone would also have to do so for women who want to identify as men. This mandate included no exemptions for religious liberty, no protections for conscience, and no considerations at all about best medical judgment: Many doctors, after all, think hormonal and surgical “transition” procedures are bad medicine. They consider the appropriate medical response to gender dysphoria is one directed at the mind and the emotions, not at the body. Which, of course, leads to the final concern: ideology. Transgender ideology is promoted not only in schools — where children are taught that gender is fluid, falls along a spectrum, and is detached from bodily sex — but increasingly in all walks of life, where no one may dare dissent from transgender-affirming protocols. Activists go after anyone who expresses any reservations about social transition for 5-year-olds, puberty blockers for 9-year-olds, and testosterone for 14-year-old girls. Just last week, two parents lost custody of their teenage daughter because a judge ruled that it was in her best interest to receive transition therapy, against her parents’ wishes. But contrary to the claims of activists, sex isn’t “assigned” at birth — and that’s why it can’t be “reassigned.” Sex is a bodily reality that can be recognized well before birth with ultrasound imaging. Cosmetic surgery and cross-sex hormones don’t change the deeper biological reality. People who undergo sex-reassignment procedures do not become the opposite sex; they merely masculinize or feminize their outward appearance. The medical evidence suggests that sex reassignment does not adequately address the psychosocial problems suffered by people who identify as transgender. Even when the procedures are successful technically and cosmetically, and even in cultures that are relatively “trans-friendly,” transitioners still face poor outcomes. In truth, very little is understood about the causes of discordant gender identities. Starting a child on an experimental process of “social transitioning” followed by puberty-blocking drugs and cross-sex hormones was unthinkable not long ago. A more cautious therapeutic approach begins by acknowledging that 80 to 95 percent of children with gender dysphoria will grow out of it naturally.

The most helpful therapies do not try to remake the body to conform with thoughts and feelings — which is impossible — but rather to help people move toward accepting the reality of their bodily selves. Children are especially vulnerable, and while we need to respect the dignity of people who identify as transgender, we must do everything possible to protect young people and foster their healthy development. That will require acknowledging that it is not discriminatory for public policy to take our sexual embodiment seriously."},

"], "text": "Sex “reassignment” doesn’t work. It’s impossible to “reassign” someone’s sex physically, and attempting to do so doesn’t produce good outcomes psychosocially. As I demonstrate in my book, “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment,” the medical evidence suggests that sex reassignment does not adequately address the psychosocial difficulties faced by people who identify as transgender. Even when the procedures are successful technically and cosmetically, and even in cultures that are relatively “trans-friendly,” transitioners still face poor outcomes. Dr. Paul McHugh, the university distinguished service professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, explains: When ‘the tumult and shouting dies,’ it proves not easy nor wise to live in a counterfeit sexual garb. The most thorough follow-up of sex-reassigned people—extending over 30 years and conducted in Sweden, where the culture is strongly supportive of the transgendered—documents their lifelong mental unrest. Ten to 15 years after surgical reassignment, the suicide rate of those who had undergone sex-reassignment surgery rose to 20 times that of comparable peers. McHugh points to the reality that because sex change is physically impossible, it frequently does not provide the long-term wholeness and happiness that people seek. Indeed, the best scientific research supports McHugh’s caution and concern. Here’s how The Guardian summarized the results of a review of “more than 100 follow-up studies of post-operative transsexuals” by Birmingham University’s Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility: “There is huge uncertainty over whether changing someone’s sex is a good or a bad thing,” said Chris Hyde, the director of the facility. Even if doctors are careful to perform these procedures only on “appropriate patients,” Hyde continued, “there’s still a large number of people who have the surgery but remain traumatized—often to the point of committing suicide.” Of particular concern are the people these studies “lost track of.” As The Guardian noted, “the results of many gender reassignment studies are unsound because researchers lost track of more than half of the participants.” Indeed, “Dr. Hyde said the high drop-out rate could reflect high levels of dissatisfaction or even suicide among post-operative transsexuals.” Hyde concluded: “The bottom line is that although it’s clear that some people do well with gender reassignment surgery, the available research does little to reassure about how many patients do badly and, if so, how badly.” The facility conducted its review back in 2004, so perhaps things have changed in the past decade? Not so. In 2014, a new review of the scientific literature was done by Hayes, Inc., a research and consulting firm that evaluates the safety and health outcomes of medical technologies. Hayes found that the evidence on long-term results of sex reassignment was too sparse to support meaningful conclusions and gave these studies its lowest rating for quality: The Obama administration came to similar conclusions. In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services revisited the question of whether sex reassignment surgery would have to be covered by Medicare plans. Despite receiving a request that its coverage be mandated, it refused, on the ground that we lack evidence that it benefits patients. Here’s how the June 2016 “Proposed Decision Memo for Gender Dysphoria and Gender Reassignment Surgery” put it: The final August 2016 memo was even more blunt. It pointed out: That “lost to follow-up,” remember, could be pointing to people who committed suicide. And when it comes to the best studies, there is no evidence of “clinically significant changes” after sex reassignment: In a discussion of the largest and most robust study—the study from Sweden that McHugh mentioned in the quote above—the Obama Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pointed out the 19-times-greater likelihood for death by suicide, and a host of other poor outcomes: These results are tragic. And they directly contradict the most popular media narratives, as well as many of the snapshot studies that do not track people over time. As the Obama Centers for Medicare and Medicaid pointed out, “mortality from this patient population did not become apparent until after 10 years.” So when the media tout studies that only track outcomes for a few years, and claim that reassignment is a stunning success, there are good grounds for skepticism. As I explain in my book, these outcomes should be enough to stop the headlong rush into sex reassignment procedures. They should prompt us to develop better therapies for helping people who struggle with their gender identity. And none of this even begins to address the radical, entirely experimental therapies that are being directed at the bodies of children to transition them. Sex Change Is Physically Impossible We’ve seen some of the evidence that sex reassignment doesn’t produce good outcomes psychosocially. And as McHugh suggested above, part of the reason why is because sex change is impossible and “it proves not easy nor wise to live in a counterfeit sexual garb.” But what is the basis for the conclusion that sex change is impossible? Contrary to the claims of activists, sex isn’t “assigned” at birth—and that’s why it can’t be “reassigned.” As I explain in “When Harry Became Sally,” sex is a bodily reality that can be recognized well before birth with ultrasound imaging. The sex of an organism is defined and identified by the way in which it (he or she) is organized for sexual reproduction. This is just one manifestation of the fact that natural organization is “the defining feature of an organism,” as neuroscientist Maureen Condic and her philosopher brother Samuel Condic explain. In organisms, “the various parts … are organized to cooperatively interact for the welfare of the entity as a whole. Organisms can exist at various levels, from microscopic single cells to sperm whales weighing many tons, yet they are all characterized by the integrated function of parts for the sake of the whole.” Male and female organisms have different parts that are functionally integrated for the sake of their whole, and for the sake of a larger whole—their sexual union and reproduction. So an organism’s sex—as male or female—is identified by its organization for sexually reproductive acts. Sex as a status—male or female—is a recognition of the organization of a body that can engage in sex as an act. That organization isn’t just the best way to figure out which sex you are. It’s the only way to make sense of the concepts of male and female at all. What else could “maleness” or “femaleness” even refer to, if not your basic physical capacity for one of two functions in sexual reproduction? The conceptual distinction between male and female based on reproductive organization provides the only coherent way to classify the two sexes. Apart from that, all we have are stereotypes. This shouldn’t be controversial. Sex is understood this way across sexually reproducing species. No one finds it particularly difficult—let alone controversial—to identify male and female members of the bovine species or the canine species. Farmers and breeders rely on this easy distinction for their livelihoods. It’s only recently, and only with respect to the human species, that the very concept of sex has become controversial. And yet, in an expert declaration to a federal district court in North Carolina concerning H.B. 2 (a state law governing access to sex-specific restrooms), Dr. Deanna Adkins stated, “From a medical perspective, the appropriate determinant of sex is gender identity.” Adkins is a professor at Duke University School of Medicine and the director of the Duke Center for Child and Adolescent Gender Care (which opened in 2015). Adkins argues that gender identity is not only the preferred basis for determining sex, but “the only medically supported determinant of sex.” Every other method is bad science, she claims: “It is counter to medical science to use chromosomes, hormones, internal reproductive organs, external genitalia, or secondary sex characteristics to override gender identity for purposes of classifying someone as male or female.” In her sworn declaration to the federal court, Adkins called the standard account of sex—an organism’s sexual organization—“an extremely outdated view of biological sex.” Dr. Lawrence Mayer responded in his rebuttal declaration: “This statement is stunning. I have searched dozens of references in biology, medicine and genetics—even Wiki!—and can find no alternative scientific definition. In fact, the only references to a more fluid definition of biological sex are in the social policy literature.” Just so. Mayer is a scholar in residence in the Department of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a professor of statistics and biostatistics at Arizona State University. Modern science shows that our sexual organization begins with our DNA and development in the womb, and that sex differences manifest themselves in many bodily systems and organs, all the way down to the molecular level. In other words, our physical organization for one of two functions in reproduction shapes us organically, from the beginning of life, at every level of our being. Cosmetic surgery and cross-sex hormones can’t change us into the opposite sex. They can affect appearances. They can stunt or damage some outward expressions of our reproductive organization. But they can’t transform it. They can’t turn us from one sex into the other. “Scientifically speaking, transgender men are not biological men and transgender women are not biological women. The claims to the contrary are not supported by a scintilla of scientific evidence,” explains Mayer. Or, as Princeton philosopher Robert P. George put it, “Changing sexes is a metaphysical impossibility because it is a biological impossibility.” The Purpose of Medicine, Emotions, and the Mind Behind the debates over therapies for people with gender dysphoria are two related questions: How do we define mental health and human flourishing? And what is the purpose of medicine, particularly psychiatry? Those general questions encompass more specific ones: If a man has an internal sense that he is a woman, is that just a variety of normal human functioning, or is it a psychopathology? Should we be concerned about the disconnection between feeling and reality, or only about the emotional distress or functional difficulties it may cause? What is the best way to help people with gender dysphoria manage their symptoms: by accepting their insistence that they are the opposite sex and supporting a surgical transition, or by encouraging them to recognize that their feelings are out of line with reality and learn how to identify with their bodies? All of these questions require philosophical analysis and worldview judgments about what “normal human functioning” looks like and what the purpose of medicine is. Settling the debates over the proper response to gender dysphoria requires more than scientific and medical evidence. Medical science alone cannot tell us what the purpose of medicine is. Science cannot answer questions about meaning or purpose in a moral sense. It can tell us about the function of this or that bodily system, but it can’t tell us what to do with that knowledge. It cannot tell us how human beings ought to act. Those are philosophical questions, as I explain in “When Harry Became Sally.” While medical science does not answer philosophical questions, every medical practitioner has a philosophical worldview, explicit or not. Some doctors may regard feelings and beliefs that are disconnected from reality as a part of normal human functioning and not a source of concern unless they cause distress. Other doctors will regard those feelings and beliefs as dysfunctional in themselves, even if the patient does not find them distressing, because they indicate a defect in mental processes. But the assumptions made by this or that psychiatrist for purposes of diagnosis and treatment cannot settle the philosophical questions: Is it good or bad or neutral to harbor feelings and beliefs that are at odds with reality? Should we accept them as the last word, or try to understand their causes and correct them, or at least mitigate their effects? While the current findings of medical science, as shown above, reveal poor psychosocial outcomes for people who have had sex reassignment therapies, that conclusion should not be where we stop. We must also look deeper for philosophical wisdom, starting with some basic truths about human well-being and healthy functioning. We should begin by recognizing that sex reassignment is physically impossible. Our minds and senses function properly when they reveal reality to us and lead us to knowledge of truth. And we flourish as human beings when we embrace the truth and live in accordance with it. A person might find some emotional relief in embracing a falsehood, but doing so would not make him or her objectively better off. Living by a falsehood keeps us from flourishing fully, whether or not it also causes distress. This philosophical view of human well-being is the foundation of a sound medical practice. Dr. Michelle Cretella, the president of the American College of Pediatricians—a group of doctors who formed their own professional guild in response to the politicization of the American Academy of Pediatrics—emphasizes that mental health care should be guided by norms grounded in reality, including the reality of the bodily self. “The norm for human development is for one’s thoughts to align with physical reality, and for one’s gender identity to align with one’s biologic sex,” she says. For human beings to flourish, they need to feel comfortable in their own bodies, readily identify with their sex, and believe that they are who they actually are. For children especially, normal development and functioning require accepting their physical being and understanding their embodied selves as male or female. Unfortunately, many professionals now view health care—including mental health care—primarily as a means of fulfilling patients’ desires, whatever those are. In the words of Leon Kass, a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, today a doctor is often seen as nothing more than “a highly competent hired syringe”: This modern vision of medicine and medical professionals gets it wrong, says Kass. Professionals ought to profess their devotion to the purposes and ideals they serve. Teachers should be devoted to learning, lawyers to justice, clergy to things divine, and physicians to “healing the sick, looking up to health and wholeness.” Healing is “the central core of medicine,” Kass writes—“to heal, to make whole, is the doctor’s primary business.” To provide the best possible care, serving the patient’s medical interests requires an understanding of human wholeness and well-being. Mental health care must be guided by a sound concept of human flourishing. The minimal standard of care should begin with a standard of normality. Cretella explains how this standard applies to mental health: Our brains and senses are designed to bring us into contact with reality, connecting us with the outside world and with the reality of ourselves. Thoughts that disguise or distort reality are misguided—and can cause harm. In “When Harry Became Sally,” I argue that we need to do a better job of helping people who face these struggles."},

If passed, the Equality Act would impact a broad spectrum of private businesses by adding “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” to laws prohibiting discrimination in public accommodations. Although the original purpose of such laws during the civil rights movement was to shield racial minorities from invidious identity-based discrimination, LGBT activists seek to abuse these laws by turning them into swords to punish people whose religious beliefs teach that marriage is between a man and a woman. This is precisely how the state of Colorado used its law to punish bakery owner Jack Phillips for creating custom cakes only for occasions and messages that align with his traditional Christian beliefs, and not for a same-sex wedding or a divorce celebration. Tim Gill, who has poured $422 million of his fortune into legislative campaigns to insert sexual orientation and gender identity into antidiscrimination laws, candidly admitted in Rolling Stone magazine that he is doing so to “punish the wicked.” That is, those who disagree with his view of marriage and sexuality. Gill and Human Rights Campaign have succeeded in passing such “SOGI” measures in 21 states and the District of Columbia. HRC also enlisted the support of corporate America to try to limit Phillips’ First Amendment freedoms at the Supreme Court. J. Crew’s Pride Month collaboration with Human Rights Campaign will fund national legislation to empower LGBT activists to leverage the power of government to punish millions of Americans for living according to their religious beliefs. And even after its campaign is over, J. Crew’s support of the Equality Act will continue channeling money from customers into legislation that will reduce their freedoms. Jim Brett, CEO for J. Crew Group Inc., has said that the brand is committed to doing what it can to help bring about “a more inclusive world.” But by supporting Human Rights Campaign and, in turn, the Equality Act, J. Crew is furthering the exclusion of its orthodox Muslim, Jewish, Catholic, and Protestant customers from public life. HRC President Chad Griffin has boasted of being able to form coalitions of major businesses, including Walmart Inc., to defeat religious freedom protections for citizens in Indiana and Arkansas. J. Crew’s Pride Month campaign also helps market homosexuality and animus toward orthodox religious believers. For instance, images of same-sex couples, children, and a celebrity are used to market the attire. Each photograph is accompanied by a quote relating to “love” or “pride.” Actor and producer Evan Jonigkeit responds to the question “What does Love First mean to you?” He says: “It’s about setting aside your preconceived notions about any particular individual and working from a place of empathy.” Such advertising advances the false notion that anyone opposing Human Rights Campaign and its mission is not only narrow-minded but a cold-hearted and unfeeling. In reality, many moral and legal reasons exist to oppose HRC’s agenda, none of which involve bigotry or hatred. It is no coincidence that corporate America prioritizes the LGBT agenda over the freedom to live according to one’s religious beliefs about marriage. Human Rights Campaign  publishes an annual ranking of that scores corporations according to their public support for “SOGI” legislation, including the Equality Act. In 2017, J. Crew received a relatively low score of 20 percent. But through its Pride Month collection, the company may be able to boost that score. Of course, any and all customers may refrain from purchasing the merchandise, or tell J. Crew to focus on its product line rather than on promoting illiberal causes. Customers also may tell the company to stop pressing the new sexual orthodoxy on them and their children. But, as both children and adults model J. Crew clothing, Human Rights Campaign’s intolerant message will spread to multiple generations of Americans, no matter how low or high the company’s sales are. Unfortunately, J. Crew is now only one of many large corporations whose cultural cronyism undermines their customers’ freedoms, and uses their own money to do it."},

Mattis’ policy largely returns the military to the transgender policy in effect prior to 2016, when President Barack Obama enacted sweeping changes based on political considerations and a Rand Corp. study later found to have “mischaracterized” much of the data surrounding service by transgender individuals. Although the lawmakers’ letter itself was not immediately released, accompanying statements by its author, Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass., give us enough to work with. For starters, Kennedy accuses President Donald Trump’s Pentagon of “cherry-picking” outdated studies to reach its conclusion. In fact, it was Obama and then-Defense Secretary Ashton Carter who cherry-picked flawed data from a dubious Rand study to support their 2016 change to the Defense Department’s transgender policy. The Rand study subsequently was found by a board of experts to have “mischaracterized” other foreign militaries’ experiences with transgender service, “dismissed concerns” on its impact on unit cohesion, and most significantly, concluded the effects on military readiness would be “minimal” despite clear evidence to the contrary. Kennedy goes on to tell Mattis that “there is a deep chasm between established medical research and the underlying analysis your department used to justify this policy.” But in reality, unlike the shaky foundation for the change to transgender policy made by Obama, the study used by Mattis to guide his decisions relies on a broad base of authoritative and current medical sources maintained by both the military and civilian communities to support its conclusions. The crux of the Pentagon’s new policy prohibits transgender individuals who suffer from gender dysphoria from serving in the military because these individuals have been found to “experience significant distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.” The Pentagon based this conclusion on its own vast amounts of medical data gathered from years of experience dealing with service members who had gender dysphoria. It also relied on publically available data documenting that transgender individuals with gender dysphoria attempt suicide at nearly nine times the U.S. average lifetime rate, and experience severe anxiety at eight times the average rate. This level of mental anxiety and distress is fundamentally incompatible with arduous military service. And despite years of effort, as studies agree, a successful treatment for gender dysphoria is yet to be found. Overlooked in Kennedy’s statements is that Mattis and the Pentagon went to great length to carve out an ability for transgender individuals to serve in the military if they don’t suffer from gender dysphoria. This was a logical and sound conclusion that helps the military fill its ranks. Finally, Kennedy seeks to make a connection between the new transgender policy and “laws against racial integration, gender integration and service by gay and lesbians.” The connection is offensive. The Pentagon’s transgender policy is no different from its treatment of hundreds of other medically disqualifying conditions such as bipolar disorder, asthma, or diabetes. These qualifications exist for two reasons—to ensure individuals are able to perform at the level expected, and to prevent harm to higher risk individuals. Although the Pentagon can’t comment on the matter because the new policy is being contested in the courts, Americans deserve to know that the Defense Department has done a commendable job. Officials have crafted a nuanced, medically supported transgender policy that finds the proper balance between allowing service by medically qualified volunteers and preventing from serving those who might endanger their unit or themselves."},

But now, a new bill in Pennsylvania poses an existential threat to that history of freedom and tolerance. State Sen. Patrick Browne, R-Lehigh County, recently introduced Senate Bill 613, which would amend the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act to include sexual orientation and gender identity as a protected class in anti-discrimination statutes. At face value, the bill promises freedom from discrimination for all Pennsylvanians. But if the liberal activists promoting the bill have their way, SB 613 would punish Pennsylvanians for their religious and moral beliefs. SB 613 is supported by none other than Tim Gill, the man dubbed “the megadonor behind the LGBTQ rights movement” by Rolling Stone magazine. When Rolling Stone profiled Gill last June, he disclosed his strategy to use his $500 million fortune to agitate for state nondiscrimination laws that pit LGBT activists against religious Americans. “We’re going into the hardest states in the country,” he told the magazine. “We’re going to punish the wicked.” Pennsylvania is next on Gill’s list. In 2015, a Gill front group, Pennsylvania for Economic Competitiveness, and Gill himself collectively donated $15,000 to the Reform PA PAC when the Fairness Act, a similar sexual orientation and gender identity law, made its debut. Another Gill front group, Pennsylvania Competes, joined forces with the Human Rights Campaign in 2015 to the same end. Now in 2018, SB 613 has been introduced as a Senate counterpart to the Fairness Act, which was reintroduced in the House this year as HR 1410. Gill’s plan to “punish” is already coming to pass in the Keystone State, even without a statewide law barring discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Cities and towns have already passed 43 local ordinances that can be used to target residents for their beliefs. Just last month, the city of Philadelphia halted the placements of two Christian foster care agencies—Catholic Social Services and Bethany Christian Services—because of their religious beliefs about the nature of the family. The agencies are now under investigation for discrimination under the city’s Fair Practices Ordinance, the city’s sexual orientation and gender identity policy. Even the very possibility of such a law being implemented can be sufficient to drive regular residents out of the public square for fear of being accused of discrimination. Take W.W. Bridal in Bloomsburg. The Christian owners of this business closed their doors at the end of March because the city is likely to pass such an ordinance. The city had considered passing such an ordinance in 2014, but it failed to clear the city council. This earlier initiative may have been designed to target W.W. Bridal for its biblical view of marriage. Even without an ordinance, the owners had no choice but to close: Activists attacked the store’s reputation by posting fake Yelp reviews and have made threats to burn the business down or shoot the owners in the head. Forced to choose between their livelihood and their beliefs, the owners chose the latter. “We will not be forced by government, local ordinances, or bullies to participate in something that goes against our faith,” the business stated in a Facebook post. Average Pennsylvanians are already vulnerable to losing their livelihoods not for holding “animus” against LGBT people, but for holding a long-established, reasonable belief about marriage. A state law could only make matters worse. Sexual orientation and gender identity laws don’t have to be interpreted this way. Anti-discrimination laws are supposed to be used to protect people, not to attack them. They should be shields, not swords. States that already have such laws on the books can and should interpret them in a nuanced way that respects different moral and religious beliefs about sexuality. Ultimately, these policies will have a chilling effect on society. Even when not directly weaponized against people with traditional beliefs, these policies still stigmatize the traditional view of marriage, which has been upheld by reasonable people of good will for thousands of years. In the long run, SB 613 would leave regular Pennsylvanians constantly vulnerable to be targeted by the government for their beliefs. This enduring threat to their livelihoods would only perpetuate animosity between both sides of the marriage debate. Sexual orientation and gender identity laws are not the path forward for mutual tolerance. Pennsylvania should uphold its rich history of peace and diversity and abandon this dangerous initiative."},
{"title": "Court Should Reject Obama's Radical Social Experiment", "author": ["Roger  Severino", "Jim  DeMint"], "date": "Dec 14, 2016 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/court-should-reject-obamas-radical-social-experiment", "takeaways": [], "text": "Once it had convinced the Supreme Court to redefine marriage for the entire nation, you would think the Obama administration would have paused and let the country catch its breath. It didn’t. Instead, it raced to impose new gender identity policies on states, employers, hospitals and even schoolchildren — without a hint of congressional approval. Late last month, the Supreme Court agreed to take a case that will either roll back this massive government overreach or allow the administration to redefine what it means to be a man and a woman under law. First, some background. The Obama administration says a person’s sex is not something that can be objectively determined by birth. Rather, it is merely a placeholder “assigned at birth,” much like a Social Security number, only far easier to change. According to the administration, one’s actual sex is discovered later in life, can range from “male, female, neither, or a combination of male and female,” and doesn’t depend on genetics, anatomy, or dressing, acting, or looking a certain way. People with gender dysphoria deserve to be treated with sensitivity and respect, and people should be free to believe whatever they want about these new gender identities, but they should not be forced upon people who have reasonable scientific, philosophical and religious objections for not going along. The administration has nevertheless threatened to strip schools of their funding unless teachers and students treat others according to their self-declared gender identities instead of biology. A teen biological girl that identifies as male sued a Virginia school district to get full access to the boys’ bathrooms. Recognizing the competing interests at issue and trying to be compassionate, the school installed single-occupancy unisex facilities as an accommodation, but the student was not satisfied. The Obama administration swiftly weighed in on the case, called Gloucester County School Board v. G.G and argued that when Congress banned sex discrimination in education in 1972, it really banned gender identity discrimination and that the schools’ accommodation was not an act of sensitivity, but bigotry. This case will have ramifications far beyond school shower, bathroom and dorm policies. That’s because the Obama administration has administratively redefined “sex” to mean “gender identity” in a host of federal anti-discrimination laws covering more than education — including housing, health care, employment, lending and federal contracting — even though the American people, through their representatives, have repeatedly rejected such proposals. The case will also affect the ability of states to protect their citizens’ privacy and safety interests. Twenty-four states and governors have already sued the administration for attempting to dictate their state’s bathroom and shower policies without legal authority. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory deserves tremendous credit for leading this effort and for standing against the progressive bullies in the media, big business and the federal government. McCrory knows that subjective and unverifiable gender identity policies threaten the safety and privacy of women and girls in intimate facilities because they open the door to abuse by non-transgender people. At the same time, he’s also set North Carolina policy to accommodate transgender people with private facilities so everyone’s privacy is protected. Large majorities favor bathroom, locker and shower policies that reflect biological realities, while also adding private accommodations for anyone who would feel uncomfortable under the rules. But the administration and LGBT activists consider this commonsense solution to be rank discrimination. We’ll find out what the Supreme Court thinks about all this soon enough. With any luck, the justices will uphold our laws as written and completely reject the administration’s social experiments."},

Anderson, Ph.D."], "date": "Feb 15, 2017 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/how-think-about-discrimination-race-sex-and-sogi", "takeaways": ["Sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) antidiscrimination policies are unjustified.", "The law must be nuanced and define key terms such as “public accommodation” and “discrimination” accurately. ", "The law must leave people free to engage in actions based on the conviction that we are created male and female and  for each other."], "text": "In a new report for the Heritage Foundation, “How to Think About Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) Policies and Religious Freedom,” I argue that current proposals to create new LGBT protections with varying types of religious exemptions will not result in what advocates claim is “Fairness for All.” Instead, they will penalize many Americans who believe that we are created male and female and that male and female are created for each other—convictions that the Supreme Court of the United States, in Obergefell v. Hodges, recognized are held “in good faith by reasonable and sincere people here and throughout the world.” As I explain in the report, current SOGI laws, including “Fairness for All,” lack the nuance and specificity necessary for cases they seek to address. They take the existing paradigm of public policy responses to racism and sexism and assume that this paradigm is appropriate for the policy needs of people who identify as LGBT. This is misguided for both conceptual and practical reasons. Conceptually, sexual orientation and gender identity are unlike race and sex in important ways, as detailed in the report. And practically, the nature and extent of SOGI discrimination in the United States today are unlike racism and sexism when antidiscrimination laws were enacted (and unlike racism and sexism even today). Put another way, the legal response that was appropriate to remedy the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow is not appropriate for today’s challenges. Simply adding SOGI to far-reaching antidiscrimination laws and then tacking on some exemptions is not a prudent strategy. The policy response to the legitimate concerns of people who identify as LGBT must be nuanced and appropriately tailored. Antidiscrimination laws, however, are blunt instruments by design, and many go beyond intentional discrimination and ban actions that have “disparate impacts” on protected classes. Policymakers therefore need to rethink how to formulate and implement policy in this area. Sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) antidiscrimination laws are unjustified, but if other policies are adopted to address the mistreatment of people who identify as LGBT, they must leave people free to engage in legitimate actions based on the conviction that we are created male and female and that male and female are created for each other. LGBT Policy Needs In responding to the legitimate needs of people who identify as LGBT while also respecting the religious freedom rights of all, policymakers must first assess the nature and extent of the problem and then determine whether governmental intervention is required and, if it is, what the appropriate remedy should be. Once a legitimate need has been identified, policymakers must ask two questions: - Is a governmental response appropriate? Are the needs of such a magnitude and extent as to warrant government attention? - Is a government response required? Are social, economic, and cultural forces sufficient to address these needs on their own? I discuss these questions in greater detail in the report. Unfortunately, many proponents of “Fairness for All” assume that adoption of SOGI laws in some form is both a good thing and inevitable, and their arguments focus largely on how to mitigate the religious liberty harms of such laws. They do not argue the need for SOGI laws robustly, with facts and studies, and thus elide the question of whether that need requires SOGI laws to address it as opposed to some less drastic measure or measures. So if a government response is judged necessary, it must be tailored to address the documented need at the appropriate level of government (federal, state, or local) while doing everything possible to avoid burdening such rights as the freedoms of contract, conscience, religion, and speech. Scope of Coverage: The Case of “Public Accommodations” Any policy response to a legitimate need must be appropriately tailored. If a policy is justified by a housing or employment need, the scope of who counts as an employer or what counts as relevant housing must be defined accurately so that it can address the problem without unnecessarily burdening others. One problem with current SOGI laws, however, is that they apply to too many sectors of life and employ unreasonably expansive definitions. The scope of coverage—areas where the law applies, penalizes, and coerces—is far too broad. For example, the Equality Act, the centerpiece of the Human Rights Campaign’s Beyond Marriage Equality Initiative, would add “sexual orientation” and “gender identity” to virtually all federal civil rights laws covering race—“Public Accommodations, Education, Federal Financial Assistance, Employment, Housing, Credit, and Federal Jury Service”—and expand them beyond their current reach. Moreover, it is explicitly designed to shrink existing religious liberty protections. It also would stretch the scope of “public accommodations” quite far. The Civil Rights Act of 1964—the purpose of which was to integrate half of the continental United States after centuries of race-based slavery and Jim Crow—covered entities such as hotels, restaurants, theaters, and gas stations. The Equality Act would cover almost every business serving the public. Another proposal, a 2014 SOGI law passed by the Houston City Council—but later repealed by a supermajority of the city’s voters—would have covered “every business with a physical location in the city, whether wholesale or retail, which is open to the general public and offers for compensation any product, service, or facility.” No inch of the public square would have been spared its costs to conscience, pluralism, and speech. By contrast, at common law, the term “public accommodations” is used to refer to public utilities, common carriers, and other natural monopolies that have a general duty to serve the public. Likewise, the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not apply to bakeries. Yet racial discrimination is not rampant at Dunkin’ Donuts, not least because all incentives are aligned against it. Because “sex” is not a protected class for federal antidiscrimination law for public accommodations, federal law allows restaurants of any size to refuse to admit women. It also allows theaters and stadiums to turn away Democrats just for being Democrats and Republicans just for being Republicans. Yet culture and commerce prevent these and other forms of discrimination without any help from the law. Thus, the first step to finding an appropriate policy solution is to consider the scope of coverage. A policy response must be tailored to the need that justifies it in the first place. This entails defining key terms such as “public accommodations” appropriately. Definition of Key Terms: “Discrimination” The second step is to define “discrimination” accurately. The biggest problem with current SOGI laws, including “Fairness for All,” is that they do not appropriately define what counts as discriminatory. To illustrate this, consider several different cases of putative “discrimination.” The law must be nuanced enough to capture the important differences in these cases. Invidious and Rightly Unlawful Discrimination. Racially segregated water fountains were one form of discrimination that took race into consideration—in a context where it was completely irrelevant—and then treated blacks as second-class citizens precisely because they were black. The entire point was to classify on the basis of race in order to treat blacks as socially inferior. As a result, such actions were rightly described as invidious race-based discrimination, and—given the entrenched, widespread, state-facilitated nature of the problem—they were rightly made unlawful. Likewise, throughout much of American history, girls and women were not afforded educational opportunities equal to those available to boys and men. This form of discrimination took sex into consideration and then treated girls and women poorly precisely because of their sex, barring them from education in certain subjects or at certain levels despite being otherwise qualified. As with invidious racial discrimination, such treatment took a feature (in this case, sex) into consideration precisely to treat women as less than men. The law rightly deemed such actions invidious sex-based discrimination, and—again, given the entrenched, widespread, and state-facilitated nature of the problem—Title IX of the Education Amendments was enacted to ensure that girls and women received equal educational opportunities. Appropriate and Rightly Lawful Distinctions That Are Not Classified as Discrimination. When Title IX was enacted in 1972 and its implementing regulations were promulgated in 1975, the law made clear that sex-specific housing, bathrooms, and locker rooms were not unlawful discrimination. Such policies take sex into consideration, but they do not treat women as inferior to men or men as inferior to women. They treat both sexes equally because they take sex into consideration (they “discriminate”—in the nonpejorative sense of “distinguish”—on the basis of sex) precisely in a way that matters: by appreciating the bodily sexual difference of men and women in things such as housing, bathroom, and locker room policy. Would we really be treating men and women equally in anything but an artificial way if we forced men and women, boys and girls, to undress in front of each other? Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in her majority opinion for the Supreme Court forcing the Virginia Military Institute to become co-ed, wrote that it “would undoubtedly require alterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in living arrangements.” Yet we certainly would be treating people unequally if access to intimate facilities were based on factors wholly unrelated to privacy, such as race. As a result, policymakers did not consider sex-specific intimate facilities as discriminatory in the first place, and laws explicitly reflected that commonsense understanding while rightly declaring racially segregated facilities to be unlawful. The lesson here is that not all distinctions in fact should be deemed unlawful discrimination. Not Discriminatory at All. If sex-specific intimate facilities are an example of lawful, legitimate policies that take sex into consideration, pro-life medical practices are examples of policies that are legitimate and lawful because they do not take sex into consideration at all. That only women can get pregnant has no bearing whatsoever on the judgment of the conscientious doctor or nurse who refuses to kill the unborn. The insistence of LGBT activists that men actually can become pregnant highlights the point: Pro-life medical personnel refuse to do abortions on pregnant women and “pregnant men” (i.e., women who identify as men). Thus, we can identify three different types of cases: - Cases of invidious discrimination, in which an irrelevant factor is taken into consideration in order to treat people poorly based on that factor, as with racially segregated water fountains; - Cases of distinctions without unlawful discrimination, in which a factor is taken into consideration precisely because it is relevant to the underlying policy and people are not treated poorly, as with sex-specific intimate facilities; and - Cases with neither distinctions nor discrimination, in which a particular factor simply does not enter into consideration, as with pro-life doctors. Any proposed policy intended to address the documented needs of people who identify as LGBT must take these categories into account without conflation. 1 SOGI Discrimination: Real and Imagined. Consider a florist who refused to serve all customers who identify as LGBT simply because they identified as LGBT. That would be a case of invidious discrimination because the mere knowledge that they identify as LGBT should have no impact whatsoever on the act of the florist selling flowers, because there is no rational connection between the two. Now consider Baronelle Stutzman, the 71-year-old grandmother who served one particular gay costumer for nearly a decade but declined to do the wedding flowers for his same-sex wedding ceremony. The customer’s sexual orientation did not play any role in Stutzman’s decision. Her belief that marriage is a union of sexually complementary spouses does not spring from any convictions about people who identify as LGBT. When she says she can do wedding flowers only for true weddings, she makes no distinctions based on sexual orientation at all. This is seen most clearly in the case of Catholic Charities adoption agencies. They decline to place the children entrusted to their care with same-sex couples not because of their sexual orientation, but because of the conviction that children deserve both a mother and a father. That belief—that men and women are not interchangeable, mothers and fathers are not replaceable, the two best dads in the world cannot make up for a missing mom, and the two best moms in the world cannot make up for a missing dad—has absolutely nothing to do with sexual orientation. Catholic Charities does not say that people who identify as LGBT cannot love or care for children; it does not take sexual orientation into consideration at all. Its preference for placing children with mothers and fathers is not an instance of discrimination based on sexual orientation—and the law should not say otherwise. Purported gender identity discrimination presents similar problems. The Washington Post recently reported on a woman who was suing a Catholic hospital for declining to perform a sex reassignment procedure on her that entailed removing her healthy uterus. In that report, the Post captures the conflation of real and imaginary discrimination: “What the rule says is if you provide a particular service to anybody, you can’t refuse to provide it to anyone,” said Sarah Warbelow, the legal director for the Human Rights Campaign. That means a transgender person who shows up at an emergency room with something as basic as a twisted ankle cannot be denied care, as sometimes happens, Warbelow said. That also means if a doctor provides breast reconstruction surgery or hormone therapy, those services cannot be denied to transgender patients seeking them for gender dysphoria, she said. The two examples given, however, differ in significant ways. A hospital that refuses to treat the twisted ankles of people who identify as transgender simply because they identify as transgender would be engaging in invidious discrimination, but a hospital that declines to remove the perfectly healthy uterus of a woman who identifies as a man is not engaging in “gender identity” discrimination. The gender identity of the patient plays no role in the decision-making process: just as pro-life physicians do not kill unborn babies, regardless of the sex or gender identity of the pregnant person, doctors do not remove healthy uteruses from any patients, regardless of how they identify themselves. As for the Human Rights Campaign spokesperson’s claim that emergency rooms “sometimes” refuse to treat the twisted ankles of transgender patients, there is no evidence—including on the HRC’s website—that it or anything similar in fact happens. Furthermore, insofar as this “sometimes happens,” it seems reasonable to think that the media would focus so much attention on it that the hospital would reverse course within hours. It therefore seems highly unlikely that this alleged problem merits a governmental response. In any event, if analysis of the scope and extent of a need and of the cultural and social forces at play indicates that people who identify as LGBT have a legitimate need that justifies governmental action, then the government’s response must be limited to the proper scope and must accurately define what counts as “discrimination.” Need for Policy Shapes the Nature of Policy Response, Definitions, and Protections “How to Think About Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) Policies and Religious Freedom” provides a framework for thinking through how to (1) identify the needs of people who identify as LGBT that government must address, (2) tailor the scope of any policy remedy appropriately, and (3) carefully distinguish which circumstances count as discrimination and which do not. If all of those steps are accomplished, another consideration comes to the fore: Any legal remedy must not penalize valid forms of action and interaction or burden the rights of conscience, religion, and speech. Because there was such widespread, entrenched systemic and institutional racism throughout American society in the 1960s, for example, and because social and market forces were not sufficient to remedy the problem, it was appropriate for government to respond. That response was properly tailored to meet this need. It defined discrimination to include racially segregated accommodations, places of employment, and housing providers while providing thin religious liberty protections. Because the justification for antidiscrimination laws based on race was so strong and the need was so great, the law was appropriately broad with limited exemptions. By contrast, consider laws that address discrimination based on sex. Because the nature of sex and the history of sexism did not represent an exact parallel to racism, the law did not treat them in entirely the same ways. To this day, for example, sex is not a protected class for federal antidiscrimination law as applied to public accommodations. Discrimination was legally defined so as not to include sex-specific intimate facilities, and much broader—and in some cases total—religious liberty exemptions were included. In other words, because the justification for laws against sex-based discrimination was weaker than the justification for laws against race-based discrimination, the legal response was more modest: It covered less terrain, defined discrimination more narrowly, and provided greater protection for religious liberty. Any proposed policies intended to meet the needs of people who identify as LGBT would need to be crafted in a similar manner. Without greater evidence of the justification for specific policy responses—greater documentation of what the needs truly are—it is hard to be specific. In general, however, the need clearly seems weaker than the need for policies designed to deal with discrimination on the basis of race and sex. A policy response would therefore need to cover less ground, target discrimination more narrowly, and avoid undermining the rights of conscience, religion, and speech. Policy Responses Matter Because of the Messages They Send Getting public policy right matters both because the law is binding and because the law is a teacher. A law that burdens and penalizes nondiscriminatory actions and violates the rights of conscience, religion, and speech is purely and simply unjust, and an unjust law that supposedly applies to all Americans while exempting a select few from its provisions hardly represents “Fairness for All.” “Fairness for All” advocates who believe the truth about marriage, human nature, and human embodiment should consider how the law would teach future generations that this truth is a lie and that a lie is the truth. Any good that an exemption from the law preserves for religious communities will pale in comparison to the damage that the law does in its pedagogical function. Some LGBT activists express concerns about the message that religious exemptions send. They claim that such laws teach that people have a “license to discriminate.” But their criticism proves the point: SOGI laws will teach that legitimate conduct and judgments discriminate, are morally wrong, and should therefore not be given a “license.” Much better, then, not to have the law define such actions as discrimination in the first place. In the aftermath of the judicially imposed legal redefinition of marriage, the law should not be used to punish and hound those who continue to believe that marriage unites husband and wife. The law should respect their full and equal status as citizens. If Obergefell was about respecting the freedom of people who identify as LGBT to live as they wish, as LGBT activists claim, then that same freedom should be respected for Americans who believe in the conjugal understanding of marriage as the union of husband and wife. The law should not force these Americans into the closet."},

While only 23 percent of American women identify as feminists, 47 percent of millennial women do. Unfortunately, policies supported by modern feminists have proved particularly bad for young women. Many of today's young women struggle with significant student loan debt and have a hard time finding a job that will get them out of mom and dad's basement. About 42 percent of women have more than $30,000 in student loan debt, compared to just 27 percent of men. This could be a result of the increase we've seen in the number of women pursuing higher levels of learning. But significant student loan defaults among this group indicate that women may not be getting a good return on investment. Women are vastly overrepresented in majors that are known to have low returns on investment, such as gender studies or social work. Yet the feminist movement encourages more young women to pursue these degrees. Their solution is to advocate for further government assistance through policies such as free public college, loan forgiveness and income-based repayment policies that drag out the life of a loan while doing nothing to put pressure on colleges to keep prices in check. One of modern feminism's stated goals is to eliminate the perceived wage gap. The movement claims that women are paid 77 cents for every dollar a man makes for the same work, and that this discrepancy is due to rampant sexism in the workplace. However, the 77 cent statistic has been proven to be very misleading. This oft-cited figure is calculated simply by dividing the average salary of women by the average salary of men. However, when controlling for education, experience, hours worked and other factors that would contribute to earnings, the wage gap virtually disappears. Moreover, women sometimes pursue less-lucrative fields than men, or take time off work for family obligations. Yet students at Georgetown University claimed to be traumatized by one of modern feminism's greatest critics, Christina Hoff Sommers, after one of her talks about the trigger warning culture. Hoff Sommers frequently discusses how statistics on the gender gap or campus sexual assault can be misleading. But instead of listening to facts, some women on college campuses meet new information with hostility and anger. It does a disservice to young women on college campuses to hear that no matter how smart or driven they are, the world is stacked against them - particularly when wage data indicate that this simply is not the case. This encourages young women to see themselves as victims of a faceless adversary before they have even entered the workforce. Advocating for policies that force others to bear the consequences of one's decisions, such as loan forgiveness, will not advance the position of women, many of whom don't hold bachelor's degrees (as is the case with many men), and all of whom see their taxes increase as a result. Feminism used to be about removing the barriers of opportunity for all women. Unfortunately, the ideology has taken a sharp departure from its roots. Instead, modern feminism has become a lobbying group for liberal policies that do little to empower millennial women to climb the ladder of economic opportunity. Events such as this week's Day Without a Woman don't really help. Women on college campuses should reconsider whether modern feminism is helping advance their position or whether they should pursue their hopes and dreams on their own terms. If feminists on college campuses encourage young women to tune out the opinions of others and advocate for policies that disenfranchise conservative women and men, this generation of women will be known for its flashy protests but little else."},

It’s wrong, and we should all condemn it. I condemn it in my new book “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment.” But we lose the ability to effectively call out bigotry when all disagreement is condemned as bigoted—and when lies are told in the process. That’s what happened earlier this week in a New York Times op-ed. Jennifer Finney Boylan, a contributing opinion writer for the Times, and a professor of English at Barnard College of Columbia University, told several bald-faced lies about my work. I’m surprised the editors published it. For the record, Boylan never contacted me regarding my research or my book. Nor did the Times contact me to verify any of the claims made about me in the column. Boylan claims I wrote “a book that suggests that transgender people are crazy, and that what we [people who identify as transgender] deserve at every turn is scorn, contempt, and belittlement.” Good luck finding a single line from my book to back up either claim. I wrote nothing of the sort. On the contrary, at several points in the book I admonish my fellow social conservatives not to treat people who identify as transgender with “scorn, contempt and belittlement.” Indeed, the introduction to the book notes that: The very next sentence reads: “In this light, social conservatives (including myself) should take care to be respectful and compassionate toward people we may disagree with.” I repeat the point in Chapter 3 itself, writing: “This charge should prompt social conservatives (like myself) to be careful not to attack or marginalize people as we advocate for the truth.” The admonition appears once again in the conclusion: “First and foremost, as we advocate for the truth, we must be careful not to stigmatize those who are suffering.” And the book practices what it preaches. That’s also why the Times op-ed was unable to produce even a snippet from the book to back its baseless claim that I urge treating people who identify as trans with “scorn, contempt and belittlement.” Then there’s Boylan’s assertion that I “suggest that transgender people are crazy.” Nowhere do I make any such suggestion. Throughout the book, I point out that the feelings that people who identify as transgender report are real—they really feel a disconnect with their bodily sex—but I also acknowledge the fact that those feelings don’t change bodily reality. I recognize the real distress that gender dysphoria can cause, but never do I call people experiencing it crazy. I repeatedly acknowledge that gender dysphoria is a serious condition, that people who experience a gender identity conflict should be treated with respect and civility, that we need to find better responses to people struggling with their gender identities. Anyone who has read my book would know all of this. Sadly, it appears that Boylan did not. The hit piece contains no discussion of what I actually wrote, no quotation of my words, not even the briefest summary of a single claim I actually make. Instead, it links to a “review” of the book by Zack Ford, a gay rights activist at ThinkProgress. Ford immediately jumped to Boylan’s defense on Twitter, writing: “You call them mentally ill.” I replied: “Simple. Please quote the passage where I ‘call them mentally ill.’ You can’t quote that passage because it doesn’t exist.” Indeed, Ford was unable to quote any passage. This isn’t the first time that a mainstream media outlet fell for Ford’s misreporting. Before the book was released, The Washington Post wrote an embarrassingly bad story about it, chock full of factual errors. By the end of the day the Post had entirely rewritten the first half of the piece, but never even acknowledged its errors. Americans disagree about gender identity and the best approaches to treating gender dysphoria. Boylan claims my book is “abundant in junk science,” but couldn’t point to anything in particular that I got wrong. As I explain in “When Harry Became Sally,” contrary to the claims of activists, sex isn’t “assigned” at birth—and that’s why it can’t be “reassigned.” Sex is a bodily reality that can be recognized well before birth with ultrasound imaging. Cosmetic surgery and cross-sex hormones don’t change the deeper biological reality. People who undergo sex-reassignment procedures do not become the opposite sex—they merely masculinize or feminize their outward appearance. The medical evidence suggests that sex reassignment does not adequately address the psychosocial difficulties faced by people who identify as transgender. Even when the procedures are successful technically and cosmetically, and even in cultures that are relatively “trans-friendly,” transitioners still face poor outcomes. In truth, very little is understood about the causes of discordant gender identities, and yet we are now promoting radical, experimental therapies for children. Starting a child on an experimental process of “social transitioning” followed by puberty-blocking drugs and cross-sex hormones was unthinkable not long ago. It should still be today. A more cautious therapeutic approach begins by acknowledging that 80 to 95 percent of children with gender dysphoria will grow out of it naturally. Many experts think of gender dysphoria as being much like other kinds of dysphoria, or serious discomfort with one’s body, such as anorexia. The most helpful therapies do not try to remake the body to conform with thoughts and feelings—which is impossible—but rather to help people move toward accepting the reality of their bodily selves. Children are especially vulnerable. We need to respect the dignity of people who identify as transgender, while also doing everything possible to protect young people and foster their healthy development. That will require a better conversation about these issues, and that’s why I wrote my book. How sad that The New York Times, The Washington Post, and ThinkProgress refuse to participate in that conversation."},

Proponents of the law praise it as “glass ceiling-shattering.” But having the ceiling dropped down on women through mandatory gender quotas is hardly the same feat as climbing to new heights on their own ability. Woman have made huge strides in the workplace over the past decades—gaining higher educations, filling more advanced roles, earning higher incomes, and pushing the envelope on flexibility and family-friendly policies that benefit men and women alike. California’s new law not only fails to recognize the gains women have made, it implies that women are undeserving based on their own merits. A 2017 PwC analysis found that while a majority of companies in the S&P 500 had at least one woman on their boards, only 25 percent had two or more. Certain lawmakers don’t think that gender ratio is adequate. They seem to think they know how to run businesses better than corporate managers. One of the bill’s sponsors, Democratic Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson, reportedly said, “We are going to require this because it’s going to benefit the economy. It’s going to benefit each of these companies.” That’s a scary notion. What other ways do politicians think they need to interject themselves in private businesses’ operations for the supposed benefits of those corporations and the economy? More likely, politicians are more concerned with helping women. That’s not a bad thing, except when they seek to do so to the detriment of others. The problem is that this law will likely backfire on would-be female corporate board members. The law is estimated to create 684 corporate board slots for women across 377 California-headquartered companiesthat are on the Russell 3000. But how will those newly minted female board members feel amid resentment from fellow board members who watched their talented and hardworking male peers get canned for no reason other than their gender? Will newly appointed female board members earn the same respect from their peers? Will their voices carry the same weight if everyone views female board members as Title IX recipients, as opposed to intelligent and valuable contributors? Or will they be relegated to “placeholder” status as argued by Lucy Dunn, the president and CEO of the Orange County Business Council. California’s new law affects only an elite subset of the population, but it would establish a slippery slope. If governments can dictate the male-female makeup of corporate boards, why not also their racial composition? Maybe even their members’ eye and hair color. And what about other occupations? If governments intervene to break up male-dominated occupations, why not female-dominated ones as well? My children’s elementary school has zero male teachers in five of its six grades. I, along with many other parents, think schools and children would benefit from more male teachers. But does that mean the government should mandate that men make up half of schools’ teaching staffs or half of hospitals’ nursing staffs? Virtually all Americans agree that men and women deserve equal treatment and opportunity, and that is the law of the land. Accordingly, California’s law is unlikely to hold up in a court of law, because it violates both the U.S. and California Constitutions’ Equal Protection Clauses, as well as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. California lawmakers may be well-intentioned in pursuing more equal gender ratios in the corporate boardroom, but in failing to recognize that women are better off standing on their own two feet than riding on the coattails of predominantly male lawmakers, they’ve done both men and women a disservice."},

Yenor demonstrates that a key premise of transgender discourse—the disassociation of biological sex from gender identity—is rooted in Beauvoir’s effort to show that femininity is not a biological fact but is imposed by society. He traces the development of this idea through first- and second-wave feminist thought, culminating in today’s radical claims that small children should be allowed to choose their gender identity and even receive hormone therapy, and that everyone should be free to use the bathroom or locker room that suits his or her identity. Yenor’s essay is an intellectual history, not a diatribe. He concludes that the objective of transgender theory is to stop treating “gender dysphoria” in children as “a pathological syndrome requiring counseling and preventive parenting.” Rather, its “ultimate goal is public recognition of queer theory’s view of the human landscape”—an aim that leads to a fundamental conflict. In demanding that children be free to choose their gender, transgender activists would condemn as child abuse parental actions that fail to respect their child’s gender selection. Ontario’s Minister of Children and Youth Services Michael Coteau took such a position earlier this year. In response to Yenor’s scholarly inquiry, Boise State officials reacted in a fashion now familiar on campuses nationwide. The university’s Director for Diversity and Inclusion charged in a statement that Yenor and others sharing his views have a “pathetic fear of change,” and that his essay “includes a seed of hate that needs to be labeled for what it is, the spirit of an ideological animal called supremacy.” Members of the faculty senate concurred that Yenor’s scholarship was fascistic “hate speech.” Just publishing the essay represented a violation of women’s and transgender rights, they suggested. Meantime, students have gathered over 2,100 signatures on a petition demanding that the university fire Yenor. His scholarship, they allege, threatens “the existence of queer and non-binary folks.” Under pressure of condemnation from fellow students and potentially damaged career prospects, a would-be student defender of Yenor’s academic freedom has redacted his column in the student newspaper and relented in his support for the professor’s right to academic freedom. Other supporters, fearing similar reprisals, have silenced themselves. No counterargument to the professor’s scholarship has been presented. Instead of rational debate, Boise State authorities demand that certain questions be removed from the sphere of legitimate scholarly analysis—a betrayal of the purpose of any university. Satisfying these directives would mean, for Yenor, no further scholarship concerning the family, religious liberty, or the nature of human sexuality. Tenure may protect Yenor’s academic freedom, for now. Boise State dean Corey Cook says that he’s “not willing to condemn” him. Yet, on campuses, an empowered vanguard’s demand for unflinching reverence for “collegiality, caring, tolerance” increasingly overwhelms intellectual liberty. Will freedom of thought trump “tolerance”? It might—but outside academia, its prospects are growing more uncertain. After all, unlike Yenor, few Americas enjoy tenure protection and the intellectual independence that it safeguards."},

That question may still be up in the air, but now we are being forced to confront a more fundamental debate: whether men can really become women. America is in the midst of what has been called a “transgender moment.” In the space of a year, transgender issues went from something that most Americans had never heard of to a cause claiming the mantle of civil rights. But can a boy truly be “trapped” in a girl’s body? Can modern medicine really “reassign” sex? Is sex something “assigned” in the first place? What’s the loving response to a friend or child experiencing a gender-identity conflict? What should our law say on these issues? These shouldn’t be difficult questions. Just a few years before “When Harry Met Sally” hit theaters, Dr. Paul McHugh thought he had convinced the vast majority of medical professionals not to go along with bold claims about sex and gender being proffered by some of his colleagues. And as chair of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Medical School and psychiatrist-in-chief at Johns Hopkins Hospital, McHugh put a stop to sex reassignment surgery at Hopkins. Once the elite Johns Hopkins did this, many medical centers across the nation followed suit. But in recent years we have seen a resurgence of these drastic procedures—not in light of new scientific evidence, mind you, but as a result of a growing ideological movement. Such is our transgender moment. The people increasingly in the spotlight of this moment are children. In the past 10 years, dozens of pediatric gender clinics have sprung up throughout the United States. In 2007, Boston Children’s Hospital “became the first major program in the United States to focus on transgender children and adolescents,” as their own website brags. A decade later, over 45 gender clinics had opened their doors to our nation’s children—telling parents that puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones may be the only way to prevent teen suicides. Never mind that according to the best studies—the ones that even transgender activists themselves cite—80 to 95 percent of children with gender dysphoria will come to identify with and embrace their bodily sex. Never mind that 41 percent of people who identify as transgender will attempt suicide at some point in their lives, compared to 4.6 percent of the general population. Never mind that people who have had transition surgery are nineteen times more likely than average to die by suicide. These statistics should stop us in our tracks. Clearly, we must work to find ways to effectively prevent these suicides and address the underlying causes. We certainly shouldn’t be encouraging children to “transition.” Many psychologists and psychiatrists think of gender dysphoria as similar to other dysphorias, or forms of discomfort with one’s body, such as anorexia. The feelings of discomfort can lead to mistaken beliefs about oneself or about reality, and then to actions in accordance with those false beliefs. The most helpful therapies focus not on achieving the impossible—changing bodies to conform to thoughts and feelings—but on helping people accept and even embrace the truth about their bodies and reality. Operating in the background is a sound understanding of physical and mental health—proper function of one’s body and mind—and a sound understanding of medicine as a practice aimed at restoring health, not simply satisfying the desires of patients. For human beings to flourish, they need to feel comfortable in their own bodies, readily identify with their sex, and believe that they are who they actually are. In my new book, “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment,” I argue that McHugh got it right. The best biology, psychology, and philosophy all support an understanding of sex as a bodily reality, and of gender as a social manifestation of bodily sex. Biology isn’t bigotry. In my book I offer a balanced approach to the policy issues, a nuanced vision of human embodiment, and a sober and honest survey of the human costs of getting human nature wrong. Despite activists’ best efforts to put up a unified front, Harry cannot become Sally. Activists’ desperate insistence to the contrary suggests that the transgender moment is fleeting."},

Think about it: Before the Clinton administration began training men and women together and placing large numbers of women in combat-support roles in the military, it received ample warning from experienced military leaders of the consequences that might follow. In public testimony, the military brass told Congress something that should be fairly obvious to anyone: If you place young men and women in the prime of their sexual lives in the kind of close, prolonged proximity characteristic of all military duty, sparks are going to fly. No kidding! Attachments are going to form, sexual activity will ensue, followed by pregnancy (is this beginning to sound familiar?). The fact that there are lots of males and relatively few females will foster clandestine social competition, poisoning the work atmosphere with undercurrents of distrust and animosity, not to mention lust. Regardless of whether the situation erupts into overt rape, it will always be disruptive and undermine the cohesion, morale and discipline so vital to the success of life-and-death military missions. None of this is intended to excuse any of the behavior that has been uncovered. But the horror being expressed is a bit like parents being shocked -- shocked! -- to find that clean-cut Johnnie got straight-laced Suzy pregnant when they were allowed to spend a weekend together in the mountains. Both children must be held responsible for their actions, and face the consequences. But what did you expect? None of this is too difficult to figure out. Or is it? Remember: Military leaders had to explain all of this to Congress and the Clinton administration, and were ignored. Why? Because the government still provides a haven for certain leftover, discredited, 60s-era ideologies that don't recognize normal human behavior as given. On the contrary, they see it as the result of social conditioning. People aren't the way they are because of any innate qualities -- they're all products of their environment, the behaviorists say. Simply change their conditioning, and people will change. They'll become radical feminists! That's right. Radical feminists and their harebrained ideas about humanity are behind the current fiasco. When matters everyone else has understood since the dinosaurs were explained to feminist lawmakers like former Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., and others, the reaction was eye-rolling skepticism. Surely, feminists wondered, this \"urge\" can be controlled. What happened, they wondered, to the much-vaunted \"military discipline\" (something they had heard about long ago at summer camp)? Just impose that discipline thing, you know -- and the problem will be solved. Believe it or not, our leaders went along with this. Why? Because the current leadership of the United States not only contains a number of people who have been rendered sexually naive by their obtuse ideologies -- it also contains an even greater number who are scared spineless of the first group. Never mind that traditional military doctrine has never contended that \"military discipline\" could overcome the sexual urge; in fact, quite the contrary. It has always insisted that the close quarters of combat duty was no place to mix the sexes. Never, in literally thousands of years of military experience, has this wisdom been disproved. Get real, people: Men and women are too much of a distraction to each other to work at optimum efficiency in close military operations where life and death are at stake. Is this so hard to understand and deal with? * * * Note:Edwin J. Feulner, Ph.D. is president of The Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based public policy research institute."},

Feulner’s leadership as president of The Heritage Foundation transformed the think tank from a small policy shop into America’s powerhouse of conservative ideas and what the New York Times calls “the Parthenon of the conservative metropolis.” After serving as president from 1977 to 2013, Feulner served as president again for a brief period in 2017. Heritage’s influence grew immensely that year. After President Donald J. Trump’s inauguration, there were a number of conservative policy victories, most notably tax reform, and The Heritage Foundation played a role in all of them. In just its first year, the Trump administration embraced nearly two-thirds of the policy recommendations from Heritage’s five “Mandate for Leadership” publications.“Ed Feulner has made Heritage not just a permanent institution on Capitol Hill, but the flagship organization of the entire conservative movement,” Board Chairman Thomas A. Saunders said in December 2012. As Feulner wrote in the introduction to one of his books, The March of Freedom: “This has been a conscious goal of The Heritage Foundation—to be a permanent Washington presence. We have set out to make conservative ideas not just respectable but mainstream. To set the terms of national policy debate. To offer not a lament for a lost America, but positive, practical, free market alternatives to the failed liberal policies of the old order.” Feulner’s work in the conservative movement throughout his life has earned him praise from a range of individuals from Heritage donors to U.S. Presidents. “By building an organization dedicated to ideas and their consequences, he has helped to shape the policy of our Government. His has been a voice of reason and values in service to his country and the cause of freedom around the world,” read the citation of the Presidential Citizens Medal, given to Feulner on Jan. 18, 1989, by President Ronald Reagan. Feulner’s leadership has been internationally recognized. The Daily Telegraph (UK) named him one of the 100 most influential conservatives in America in 2007 and 2010. In a 2009 Forbes magazine article, Karl Rove ranked Feulner the 6th most powerful conservative in Washington. That same year, he was featured by the Fox News Channel on Fox News Sunday as host Chris Wallace’s “Power Player of the Week.” In July 2010, he was included in Townhall magazine’s list of “the 100 Americans the Left hates most.” In April 2009, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute (ISI) conferred upon Feulner the Charles Hoeflich Lifetime Achievement Award. In June 2012, he received the Bradley Prize for extraordinary talent and dedication at Washington’s Kennedy Center. Feulner first joined The Heritage Foundation as a founding Trustee in 1973. He later became President in 1977, Heritage’s fourth in four years. After accepting the job, Feulner was determined to chart a new course for the struggling think tank. He did not want to lead a group of academics that would write studies, place them on a shelf and hope someone important would read them. Instead, Feulner decided that Heritage would operate like a business that expected progress from its analysts and results from their policy studies. Heritage would achieve these results by creating timely, concise studies and aggressively marketing them to Congress, policymakers and the media. This “briefcase test” concept became a model for other think tanks to follow. In fact, Heritage’s success has led many liberals to try to create a “liberal Heritage Foundation” to counter the think tank’s influence. “[Conservatives] worked on it for 30 years and they’ve got it,” former President Bill Clinton complained in a 2003 appearance on NBC’s Today show. “They’ve got everything from The Heritage Foundation, the sympathetic newspapers, to sympathetic cable programs …” This didn’t happen by accident. Feulner works tirelessly. He travels more than 150,000 miles a year, crisscrossing the United States and the globe to meet with leaders and help spread the ideals of individual liberty, economic freedom, rule of law, and family values. “Although his ways are entirely unassuming, one pauses … to wonder how Ed Feulner manages as he does,” wrote National Review founder William F. Buckley Jr. in an introduction to The Power of Ideas, a 1997 book on Heritage’s history. “It helps that he disposes of the requisite biological and temperamental attributes—the capacity to go many hours without sleep, to travel endlessly attending to caseloads of work, to endure a day of meetings that begin at breakfast and end at midnight.” Feulner’s schedule is often full because of the many hats he has worn over the years: He is the former President and was the long time Treasurer of the Mont Pelerin Society; he has served as a Trustee and former Chairman of the Board of ISI; a Board Member of the National Chamber Foundation; a Board Member of the Institut d’ Etudes Politiques; a life member of the Board of Trustees of Regis University in Denver; and twice a past President of the Philadelphia Society, of which he has been elected as a Distinguished Member. Feulner is a member of the Advisory Board of the Public Diplomacy Collaborative at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. He is past Director of the Sequoia Bank, the Council for National Policy, the Acton Institute, the Aequus Institute, the International Republican Institute, the American Council on Germany, the Lehrman Institute, and George Mason University. He is a longtime officer and director of two grant-making foundations: the Sarah Scaife Foundation, and the Thomas A. Roe Foundation. Feulner formerly served as a member of the Gingrich-Mitchell Congressional U.N. Reform Task Force (2005) and on the Congressional Commission on International Financial Institutions (“Meltzer Commission”) from 1999-2000. He was the Vice Chairman of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform (“Kemp Commission”) from 1995-1996. As Chairman of the U.S. Advisory Commission on Public Diplomacy (1982-91), he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on three occasions. He served as the Public Member (Ambassador) of the U.S. Delegation to the United Nations Second Special Session on Disarmament in New York, as a consultant for domestic policy to President Reagan, and as an adviser to several government departments and agencies. Feulner speaks frequently both in the United States and abroad, and has been awarded honorary degrees from 10 colleges and universities. He has been declared a Benefactor of the University of Edinburgh, and has received honors from the governments of Taiwan, South Korea, and the Czech Republic. But his heart belongs to Heritage—and to the thousands of colleagues and supporters he has worked with over the decades. “I can’t stress it enough,” Feulner said in 2002 on his 25th anniversary as president. “If you don’t have the right people, you won’t have the success Heritage has had over the years.”\n\nAfter serving as president from 1977 to 2013, Feulner served as president again on an interim basis from 2017-2018. Heritage's influence grew immensely that year. After President Donald J. Trump's inauguration there were a number of conservative policy victories, and The Heritage Foundation played a role in all of them. Edwin John Feulner Jr. was born Aug. 12, 1941, in Chicago to Helen Joan Feulner and Edwin J. Feulner Sr., who owned a real estate firm. After growing up in suburban Chicago, Feulner attended Regis University in Denver. There he read Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater’s best-selling manifesto, The Conscience of a Conservative and Russell Kirk’s The Conservative Mind, which influenced his thinking and the direction of his life. He graduated from Regis University with double majors in English and business, and received an MBA from the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business in 1964. He later attended Georgetown University and the London School of Economics, and then earned a doctorate degree at the University of Edinburgh in 1981. Feulner began his Washington career as Public Affairs Fellow for the Center for Strategic Studies (now the Center for Strategic and International Studies) and at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, where he wrote on subjects such as economic trade embargoes with the Soviet Union. He later became a confidential assistant to Rep. and later Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird (R-WI). Afterward, Feulner became Chief of Staff to Rep. Philip M. Crane (R-IL). Before joining Heritage as its President, Feulner was Executive Director of the Republican Study Committee. Feulner is the author of nine books: The American Spirit (2012),  Getting America Right (2006), Leadership for America (2000), Intellectual Pilgrims (1999), The March of Freedom (1998), Conservatives Stalk the House (1983), Looking Back (1981), Congress and the New International Economic Order (1976), and Trading with the Communists (1968). He was the editor of U.S—Japan Mutual Security: The Next Twenty Years, China—The Turning Point, and a contributor to 10 other books and numerous journals, reviews and magazines. Feulner also was publisher of Heritage’s Policy Review magazine from 1977 until 2001, when Heritage transferred the publication to the Hoover Institution. He was the co-founder and Chairman of the website Townhall.com, which was established to coordinate online activities of dozens of conservative organizations and columnists. Feulner also pens a weekly column that appears regularly in dozens of newspapers and websites across the country."},
{"title": "Buyer Beware of CEDAW", "author": [], "date": "Aug 28, 2002 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/the-constitution/commentary/buyer-beware-cedaw", "takeaways": [], "text": "In late July, when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to send a United Nations treaty on women's rights to the floor for consideration, its chairman, Joseph Biden, D-Del., said he supported the pact because it signaled U.S. support for women's rights and would have little consequence for Americans. \"We ought to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time,\" said Sen. Biden, answering charges that the United States didn't need the treaty to prove its commitment to women's rights. \"This treaty will cost us nothing. We will not have to change any laws.\" But will it cost us nothing? The truth is, neither Biden nor any other senator knows for sure what would happen if the U.N. Convention on Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) is ratified. The treaty, signed by President Carter in 1979 but never submitted for ratification before this year, calls on governments to abolish all legal distinctions based on sex that interfere with \"human rights and fundamental freedoms.\" It seeks to end all discrimination against women and to modify \"social and cultural patterns of conduct of men and women\" to eliminate all practices based on \"stereotyped roles for men and women.\" Sounds OK on the surface. But the United States is hardly a serial violator of women's rights. Women here vote, hold public office and enjoy full protection against gender-based discrimination. Yet the treaty language seems to indicate that a variety of U.S. policies may face changes if the treaty were adopted. How many? Which? No one can say for sure. That's why, before the Senate bows to pressure to pass \"something\" to demonstrate willingness to engage in world institutions, Sen. Biden and his colleagues need to know what the United States would be called upon to do under the treaty. Senators need to know exactly what changes would be necessary in domestic and family law. And that's why, since it must enforce domestic law, the Justice Department should review CEDAW and all accompanying documentation carefully. The Bush administration, which got this process rolling in March when it asked for the treaty to be ratified, has itself requested delays so it can get more information. The Senate should do the same. The idea that action must be taken by the end of this session of Congress doesn't hold water. We've waited 23 years; we can wait a few more months for this minimal effort at due diligence. Why? Because the CEDAW committee that enforces compliance-and the non-governmental organizations, such as the aggressively pro-abortion Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, that provide \"shadow reports\" that form the basis of the committee's investigations-take what Ramesh Ponnuru of National Review magazine calls \"an expansive view\" of their mandates. The CEDAW committee has criticized Ireland, Peru, Argentina and other nations for prohibiting abortion, Belarus for establishing a Mother's Day and the Netherlands for not extending employee benefits to prostitutes. What would it criticize here? Would the United Nations try to end Mother's Day here? Would it require us to dismantle laws requiring minors to notify adults before receiving abortions? We need to know before the treaty becomes law, and a swift, but thorough, investigation can help us. A further complication requires a second review. The Senate may choose to add reservations to the treaty, such as the reservation added by Saudi Arabia to follow sharia-or Islamic law-regarding treatment of women when sharia conflicts with CEDAW. This, of course, renders the treaty mostly meaningless there. Does the United Nations honor these reservations and respect the sovereignty of the countries involved? Again, we don't know. And we should, because both President Bush and President Clinton before him had reservations they wanted included should the Senate ratify the treaty. A few months of study by the Justice Department, with help from the State Department (since it reviews U.N. actions), should clear up this matter. That's it-two relatively simple reviews. A small price to pay to ensure we know what we're getting into with CEDAW. The Senate has the final word on this. The executive branch rendered its judgment in 1979 with President Carter's signature. If Sen. Biden is correct and the treaty will cost us nothing, fine. But on the not-inconceivable chance there are costs-costs perhaps beyond what Americans are willing to pay-we need to know that, too. Before the Senate votes. Patrick Fagan is the William H.G. Fitzgerald fellow in family and cultural issues at The Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based public policy institute."},

The proposition asks whether residents wish to roll back the city’s “equal access to bathrooms and locker rooms” policy, which allows biological males to access women’s personal facilities. Although 58 percent of Anchorage residents rejected this policy by public vote in 2012, the mayor and city assembly imposed the policy in 2015 by ordinance, adding sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes under the city’s anti-discrimination policy. Now, supporters of the law are characterizing it as an “equal access” policy—even though it really means allowing members of the opposite biological sex to enter sex-specific spaces. Finding accommodations for transgender individuals need not come at the cost of bodily privacy and safety for people across the board, especially that of women. Broad “equal access” policies such as this one put the most vulnerable citizens at risk. Consider what happened earlier this year in Anchorage at the Downtown Hope Center, an overnight shelter for abused homeless women. A biological male who was born Timothy Paul Coyle, but who goes by the name Samantha Amanda Coyle, twice tried to enter the Hope Center. This is a shelter where women sleep on the floor, practically elbow to elbow. The first time, Coyle was inebriated and had just gotten into a fight with a staffer at another shelter. After denying Coyle entry to Hope Center, the staff paid Coyle’s fare to the emergency room to receive medical attention. The second time, Coyle tried to gain entry during the afternoon soup kitchen. Coyle filed a complaint with the Anchorage Equal Rights Commission claiming discrimination on the basis of gender identity under city statute AMC 5.20.050. The Hope Center responded in a letter to the commission, citing the needs of the women who shelter there: This episode in Alaska exposes the dangers of blanket sexual orientation and gender identity policies. Policies that allow biological males to share the same intimate spaces as biological females, and vice versa, raise serious privacy and safety concerns—particularly in cases dealing with the victims of domestic or sexual abuse. The most worrisome possibility is that sexual predators will feign being transgender in order to engage in inappropriate acts, such as indecent exposure, voyeurism, and sexual assault. This has already occurred multiple times—see the nine-page list of individuals charged with sex crimes in intimate facilities, compiled by The Heritage Foundation. The Anchorage policy poses an ongoing risk to all women, but particularly to those who have been victims of past sexual assault. These women are best protected by sex-specific facilities that ensure bodily privacy. They can easily be triggered by having to share intimate spaces with men, or being exposed to the male body—regardless of whether the bodily male identifies as a woman or has undergone sex reassignment surgery. So-called “equal access” policies, like AMC 5.20.050, fail to take into account the concerns of these victims. They also fail to provide sufficient safeguards against those who would abuse the law to gain access to opposite-sex facilities for nefarious purposes. This can be seen in the Anchorage public accommodations law. In the definitions portion (AMC 5.20.010), the city says that one’s gender identity can be established by medical history, consistent assertion of that identity, “or other evidence that the gender identity is sincerely held … and not being asserted for an improper purpose.” But how can one determine whether someone has an “improper purpose” in mind before an incident occurs? Since gender identity policies do not provide a clear and objective standard for who belongs where, protecting potential victims from sexual predators depends on being able to prove that the predator had improper motives. Intent is already difficult to prove, and the supposed fluidity of gender identity makes it all the more difficult to establish whether someone claimed a certain gender identity for an improper purpose. This type of law places more burden on the victims and law enforcement community to prove the predator’s intent. Such a burden would likely discourage victims from reporting incidents of voyeurism or indecent exposure. Moreover, law enforcement officials could become more wary of investigating or enforcing sex crime statutes for fear of being accused of discrimination themselves. Finding accommodations for transgender individuals should not place such a heavy burden on the rest of society. Above all, the safety of women in sex-specific facilities must not be compromised. Local institutions and authorities should work together to craft reasonable policies that keep everyone safe. Anchorage residents now have the opportunity to set things right by taking action on Proposition 1, protecting the safety and privacy of everyone in the city."},

Yet too many candidates seem oblivious to the dramatic gains women have made. They're stuck in a time warp, channeling the problems and political causes of the '60s. Outdated policy prescriptions intended to help women, can actually work to hurt us. It's time politicians recognized the realities of life for American women in 2014. Here are some salient facts. Women now have a huge edge over men when it comes to higher education. They are earning the majority of associate, bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees. For every 100 degrees men got last year, women got 140. The wage gap between men and women is now almost non-existent. Saying over and over, as the Left is prone to do, that \"women make 77 cents for every dollar men make,\" doesn't make it true. When you compare men and women in similar jobs, with similar experience, education, years in the workforce and hours worked, the wage gap all but disappears. This is especially true for the millennial generation. According to 2008 Census data, women in their 20s, living in metropolitan areas, who don't have children, earned 8% more on average than their male counterparts. And who increasingly controls money in America? Recent studies and census data show women control over 50% of private wealth in the U.S. and about 80% of household spending decisions. Over 40% of the 3 million Americans making over $500,000 a year are women. That's girl power. Unfortunately, many politicians seem to believe that the best way to win \"The Women's Vote\" is to convince women that they are lagging behind, they are victims of a country that still doesn't see them as equals, there are people out there trying to take their birth control away, and the only way to fix all this is to have government do more. Unfortunately, the Big Government approach always brings unintended consequences. Exhibit A: the \"Paycheck Fairness Act,\" a bill that would establish \"equal pay\" for men and women — no matter their level of performance. If that law were to pass, women and men could say bye-bye to more money for raises and performance pay, as businesses will have to save up for lawsuits. For a whole slew of unintended consequences, one need only look at the \"Affordable Care Act.\" Millions have already had to say so long to the doctor or health plan they wanted to keep. Many who oppose abortion feel their religious freedom has been violated. As for opportunity, \"Obamacare\" is arguably already having a negative impact on the supply and demand for full-time workers and that will likely get worse when the law goes into full effect next year. Still, many liberals insist that more government is the answer to everything, and that the way to win support is to declare that conservatives are waging a \"war on women.\" Some, however, have dropped that terminology. According to Democratic pollster Celinda Lake,\"[Saying] Republicans are waging a war on women actually doesn't test very well…Women find it divisive, political — they don't like it.\" Or perhaps instead of just not liking it, more women now recognize that it's simply not true. In a recent Rasmussen poll, 52% of likely U.S. female voters said they believed the \"war on women\" slogan is primarily used for political purposes. And in Colorado, where one of the most closely watched Senate races is happening, a Magellan Strategies poll of female swing voters found 77% of respondents said they saw through the \"war on women\" messaging strategy. Women do face challenges today – just not the ones many on the left are trying to solve via victimhood politics and policies. - Genevieve Wood is the senior contributor to The Daily Signal at the Heritage Foundation."},
{"title": "Why Any Male Student Should Think Twice Before Applying to Washington & Lee University", "author": ["Hans A. von Spakovsky"], "date": "Aug 18, 2015 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/why-any-male-student-should-think-twice-applying-washington-lee-university", "takeaways": [], "text": "This should terrify any parent whose son is about to head off to college or is presently matriculating anywhere in the Ivory Towers of academia. The fundamental lack of due process and oppressive tactics used by university administrators at Washington & Lee University (W&L) should lead any family to keep their sons from applying to the university. Male students at Washington & Lee risk serious consequences if they engage in an entirely consensual sexual relationship with a female student who later is convinced to “regret” what she did, or who becomes jealous if the male student starts a relationship with someone else. That is exactly what happened in this case. The story related to Federal District Court Judge Norman K. Moon, in a civil suit filed by a male student under an assumed name to protect his identity, reads like Kafka’s The Trial. The student, “John Doe,” is suing W&L for money damages, claiming that his expulsion violated Title IX (the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in education) and due process, and was a breach of contract. Plaintiff Doe’s key factual allegations, recounted in Judge Moon’s written opinion, are as follows: John Doe met “Jane” at an off-campus party where they talked, danced, and made out — a not uncommon occurrence among college students. While both of them drank at the party, Jane admitted she was neither incapacitated nor blacked out. At John’s invitation, Jane accompanied him back to his room. After talking for a while, Jane told John “I usually don’t have sex with someone I meet on the first night, but you are a really interesting guy.” She then took “off all her clothing except her underwear and led [John] to his bed, at which point she took John’s clothes off.” They proceeded to have oral sex, followed by sexual intercourse, including at one point where Jane switched positions “so that she was ‘on top.’” Jane never asked John “to stop or advise[d] him she did not want to have sex.” In fact, after they were done, they made out again and then Jane spent the night in John’s room. When John drove Jane home the next day, they exchanged phone numbers. According to a witness statement prepared by the university, Jane spoke to one of her friends about the encounter that day, telling her friend she had sex and stating she “had a good time last night.” She did not suggest “that anything nonconsensual happened.” Jane and John became friends on Facebook and exchanged suggestive messages where it was clear that Jane did not regret what happened; in fact, a month later she had sex with John again that she “characterized later as consensual,” according to the court. The facts show that what occurred was not only entirely consensual, but that Jane was more than just a willing participant. Jane continued to go to parties at John’s fraternity, where witnesses saw them interacting in an entirely unremarkable, normal manner. That is, until Jane saw John kissing another female “and left the party early, upset.” It became “public knowledge” that John and this other female “were an exclusive couple.” Jane subsequently spent a summer break “working at a women’s clinic that dealt with sexual assault issues.” She applied to be a Peer Counselor at W&L, presenting as her qualification research she had done on “gray rape” through a Google search. She was apparently “happy to know that there was ‘some tangible definition’ for what she claimed to have experienced” and “she presented her desire to ‘voice [her] story.’” Gray rape is a newly coined term that, according to Cosmopolitan, refers to sex that falls somewhere between consent and denial. Jane got upset when she applied for a study abroad program in Nepal and saw that John was also one of the applicants.  She talked to a “therapist” on the “evolution about how she felt about” her sexual encounters with John. Most significantly, she attended a presentation by W&L’s Title IX compliance officer, Lauren Kozak, on her article “Is it Possible That There Is Something In Between Consensual Sex and Rape … And That It Happens To Almost Every Girl Out There?”  Ms. Kozak’s thesis is that “regret equals rape”; that even if a sexual encounter is entirely consensual, if the woman later regrets what she did, the sexual encounter was actual rape. Jane then filed a sexual assault claim against John that was investigated by — you guessed it — Lauren Kozak. Ms. Kozak notified John that he needed to meet with her and the Associate Dean of Students, Jason Rodocker, within six hours, without telling him why. When John showed up at the meeting and was told what it was about — without being shown the actual complaint — he asked whether he could consult a lawyer. Kozak told him he could not be represented by a lawyer, that the school “won’t talk to them,” and that no lawyer could participate in the investigation. Kozak wouldn’t allow John to postpone the meeting, overrode his expressed desire not to be interviewed without a lawyer, and told him if he didn’t participate immediately, she would submit her investigative report without his side of what happened. John submitted to the unrelenting pressure and told Kozak what happened. At the end of the interview, she forced him to sign a pledge agreeing not to discuss the investigation with anyone and not to retaliate against Jane. She also asked him for a list of his witnesses. Of the four names he provided, Kozak did not even try to speak to two of them because she said “they already had enough facts.” Even with the very biased and incomplete manner in which Kozak and Rodocker summarized the witness statements, it is clear from reading them that Jane Doe engaged in consensual sex with John — there was no evidence of an assault. An example of how Kozak slanted the witness statements was her omitting the second half of the crucial statement Jane made to John the night they had sex the first time: Kozak wrote only that Jane had said she usually does not have sex with someone the first time she meets them, leaving entirely out of her summary that Jane then said “but you are a really interesting guy.” One of the key statements to what is behind this miscarriage of justice came from Jane Doe’s old roommate, who said Jane never told her she thought of it as a sexual assault until after Jane had “worked at a women’s clinic.” And W&L refused to consider the fact that Jane subsequently had sex with John a second time. The Dean of W&L, Tammi Simpson, told John that if he transferred to another school he would not be formally charged, a bizarre tactic to take for someone supposedly concerned about sexual assault. When he refused, John was formally charged and a hearing was held. John was given a list of possible members of the court who would hear the case and told he had to immediately voice any objections, with absolutely no information on their backgrounds or potential biases. As a result, he was unable to object to the inclusion of Professor David Novack, who has produced such memorable works as “The Gender Conundrum and Date Rape: The Potential Significance of Dimensions of Power” and “Rape Nullification in the United States: A Cultural Conspiracy.” John was told he could not discuss the hearing with anyone other than his family, thus foreclosing having legal representation at the hearing. He was refused permission to record the hearing. No direct testimony by witnesses was allowed; only the “summaries” of their statements made by Kozak and Rodocker were presented. Jane was seated behind a partition where John was not allowed to see her or to even question her directly. John had to submit written questions to the tribunal, which was presided over by Dean Simpson, and they would submit them to Jane only if they thought the questions were relevant. And the questions were not submitted in their actual form; they were instead paraphrased by the tribunal. Moreover, the tribunal refused questions that it thought “would cause [Jane] emotional distress.” Neither Dean Simpson nor the other members of the tribunal had any apparent concern over the emotional distress of John Doe over a false accusation. Jane Doe’s testimony was full of inconsistencies. Early in the hearing, she described John as “disrespectful, dishonorable, and having treated her as though she was worthless.” But when asked later in the hearing what kind of connection she had with John, “she said that it was great and [John] was smart, interesting, sweet, and genuinely interested in her.” The tribunal, however, “did not question Jane Doe about these inconsistencies.” Despite the overwhelming evidence of consensual sex, Jane’s inconsistent and conflicting claims, and the blatant falseness of the claim made against John, he was expelled from W&L by a vote of 3 to 1. No explanation was given for the decision, other than the claim that the preponderance of the evidence showed John did not have effective consent. John’s appeal to the University Board of Appeals lost by a 2 to 1 vote, again without any detailed explanation. The Lawsuit to Vindicate His Rights Following his expulsion, John filed a Title IX lawsuit, claiming among other things that the investigation and hearing “occurred in an environment that created pressure for the university to punish male students for sexual misconduct.” He blamed the May 1, 2014 announcement by the U.S. Department of Education that universities could lose federal funding if they fail to address problems with sexual violence on campus. This was prominently mentioned by W&L when it announced the appointment of Ms. Kozak as the Title IX officer. In fact, only two weeks after the tribunal voted to expel John, W&L issued a press release entitled “A Time to Examine, Affirm Our Commitments” in response to what turned out to be the false Rolling Stone article about a rape at the University of Virginia that also never occurred. The court dismissed John’s claim for violation of his right to due process because the Fifth Amendment applies to a private university like W&L only under very limited circumstances. It also dismissed his state law contract claim because the university code did not constitute a contract in Virginia law. One can argue with the dismissal of either of these claims, given the heavy regulation of colleges by the Department of Education and given the relatively weak bargaining position of students, who are asked to assent to the code as a condition of enrollment. However, the court refused to dismiss John’s claim under Title IX. In this case, the judge held that John has produced sufficient facts to “cast doubt on the accuracy of the outcome reached in the proceeding against him.” John’s allegations, taken as true, “suggest that W&L’s disciplinary procedures, at least when it comes to charges of sexual misconduct, amount to ‘a practice of railroading accused students.’” In fact, under the totality of the circumstances shown by John, “including the alleged flaws in the proceedings and statements made by W&L officials, [John] has plausibly established a causal link between his expulsion and gender bias.”  Specifically, a reasonable jury could find that ”[b]ias on the part of Ms. Kozak [caused] the outcome of John Doe’s disciplinary hearing due to the considerable influence she appears to have wielded in those proceedings.” Further, given the pressure W&L was under from the government to convict male students of sexual assault, “a reasonable fact finder could plausibly determine that [John] was wrongly found responsible for sexual misconduct and that this erroneous finding was motivated by gender bias.” This case is not over even though it should be. The court’s refusal to grant W&L’s motion to dismiss the case means it will go to trial — unless W&L’s lawyers are smart enough to convince the university to pay John a very large settlement.  Because given the facts as related in Judge Moon’s order, John Doe has a very good chance of beating W&L at trial. It appears highly likely that a jury will determine that W&L administrators conducted a one-sided, discriminatory, and unjust hearing of the allegations lodged against John Doe. Not only should W&L dismiss every university official who was involved in this profound miscarriage of justice, they should also implement basic due process rights for individuals accused in any disciplinary proceeding, as described by a group of Harvard professors last year. That means being entitled to legal representation and detailed knowledge of the charges made against you; to present evidence and cross examine witnesses directly including the accuser; to record and memorialize the proceedings; and to receive a detailed verdict that explains the basis for any findings. The burden of proof should be on the accuser and should require proving an assault occurred beyond a reasonable doubt, not on a mere preponderance of the evidence. Being convicted for something you didn’t do is a profound injustice. The effects on an individual being expelled from a university for sexual assault are profound and can be long-lasting. And no university should convict a student in a kangaroo court that tramples on basic due process rights, as W&L did in this case. Until all of these changes are made, any lawyer advising any family would tell them only one thing — you should be extremely careful about allowing your son to apply to or attend Washington & Lee University. - Hans von Spakovsky is a Senior Legal Fellow at The Heritage Foundation"},

Solutions were found, such as the creation of single-occupancy restrooms and changing facilities for students who identify as transgender while retaining girls’ and boys’ rooms for biological girls and boys. But activists attacked these commonsense compromise policies as “transphobic.” Then, last May, the Obama administration said that a 1972 law settles all of these issues: Students are to be treated the same based on their “gender identity,” regardless of their biological sex. On May 13, 2016, the Obama Administration Departments of Justice and Education sent a “Dear Colleague” letter to our nation’s schools informing them that going forward “both federal agencies [would] treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for purposes of enforcing Title IX.” The result of this decree was that schools would have to allow students access to bathrooms, locker rooms, dorm rooms, and hotel rooms for overnight field trips based on the self-declared gender identity of the student. But then on August 21, federal judge Reed O’Connor blocked the decree from going into effect in all 50 states. The judge ruled that the attempt by the Obama administration to redefine sex was unlawful, writing that “it cannot be disputed that the plain meaning of the term sex as used … following passage of Title IX meant the biological and anatomical differences between male and female students.” The Obama Department of Justice appealed this ruling in October. But just last Friday, the Trump Department of Justice withdrew that appeal and cancelled oral arguments that were to be heard this week. Judge O’Connor got it right. The Obama administration was unlawfully rewriting federal law. The term “sex” is not ambiguous, and is not subject to executive branch agencies redefinitions to now mean “gender identity.” But in addition to being unlawful, the Obama administration’s “Dear Colleague” letter is bad policy. That’s the focus of today’s panel. Today we will hear from five women, from a variety of backgrounds and experiences, explaining why the Obama-era rules turn the purpose of Title IX on its head. How the rules turn a law meant to protect women and girls into a law that allows men who claim to be women the right to enter women-only spaces. How the Obama-era rules favor the concerns of students who identify as transgender while entirely ignoring the concerns of other students. Legitimate safety, privacy, and equality concerns exist, and the Obama administration ignored them. Today, we’ll hear about those concerns. Let me briefly introduce our panelists. Miriam Ben-Shalom is an educator and activist who made history for being the first person to be reinstated to the military after being discharged from service for being openly lesbian. \n\nKaeley Triller Haver is a rape survivor whose personal experience inspired her political activism on women’s privacy and safety. She serves as the Communications Director for the Just Want Privacy Campaign in Washington State. \n\nKami Mueller is the CEO of the Mueller Group, a communications firm. She played an integral role in the communications efforts defending the state’s controversial privacy law (HB2).\n\nMary Lou Singleton is a midwife and a feminist who is an active member of the Women’s Liberation Front (WOLF), the radical feminist organization that filed a lawsuit against the Obama Administration to restore Title IX rights to women and girls. \n\nEmily Zinos is a stay at home mom who works with the Minnesota chapter of the “Ask Me First” campaign, a project sponsored by the Family Policy Alliance to defend the safety and privacy of women and children. Unfortunately due to a family medical emergency Emily is unable to be with us in person today. Mariam will read the remarks that Emily had prepared for today’s event. Following the panelists’ opening remarks, I’ll open the forum to questions and answers. Let me conclude by saying that up until last year’s prime-time interview of Bruce Jenner (as he was then called), many Americans had never had a conversation about transgender issues. It’s a conversation we need to have. But the Obama administration tried to shut down these discussions before they had even taken place. The Obama administration attempted to force a one-size-fits-all policy on the entire nation rather than allow parents and teachers and local schools the time, space, and flexibility to find nuanced solutions that respect everyone. For many Americans, gender identity concerns are a new reality. Rather than follow the Obama administration’s rush to impose a top-down solution on the entire country, we should encourage the American people to have these conversations, consider all of the relevant concerns, and make policies that will best serve all Americans. Today’s event is at the service of fostering such conversations. Please join me in welcoming our panel.\""},

There are three types of cases.", "There are cases of invidious discrimination, of distinctions without discrimination, and of neither distinctions nor discrimination.", "Any proposed policy intended to address the documented needs of people who identify as LGBT must be sensitive to these distinctions."], "text": "The biggest problem with current sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) laws—including “Fairness for All,” which proposes a grand-bargain compromise between SOGI laws and religious liberty—is that they do not appropriately define what counts as discriminatory. As I explain in a new report for The Heritage Foundation, “How to Think About Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (SOGI) Policies and Religious Freedom,” these are the laws that are being used to shutter Catholic adoption agencies, fine evangelical bakers, and force businesses and public facilities to allow men into women’s locker rooms. The problem is that liberals are calling anything they dislike “discrimination.” But liberals are getting it wrong. To illustrate this, consider several different cases of putative “discrimination.” The law must be nuanced enough to capture the important differences in these cases. Invidious and Rightly Unlawful Discrimination Racially segregated water fountains were one form of discrimination that took race into consideration—in a context where it was completely irrelevant—and then treated blacks as second-class citizens precisely because they were black. The entire point was to classify on the basis of race in order to treat blacks as socially inferior. As a result, such actions were rightly described as invidious race-based discrimination, and—given the entrenched, widespread, state-facilitated nature of the problem—they were rightly made unlawful. Likewise, throughout much of American history, girls and women were not afforded educational opportunities equal to those available to boys and men. This form of discrimination took sex into consideration and then treated girls and women poorly precisely because of their sex, barring them from education in certain subjects or at certain levels despite being otherwise qualified. As with invidious racial discrimination, such treatment took a feature (in this case, sex) into consideration precisely to treat women as less than men. The law rightly deemed such actions invidious sex-based discrimination, and—again, given the entrenched, widespread, and state-facilitated nature of the problem—Title IX of the Education Amendments was enacted to ensure that girls and women received equal educational opportunities. Appropriate and Rightly Lawful Distinctions That Are Not Classified as Discrimination When Title IX was enacted in 1972 and its implementing regulations were promulgated in 1975, the law made clear that sex-specific housing, bathrooms, and locker rooms were not unlawful discrimination. Such policies take sex into consideration, but they do not treat women as inferior to men or men as inferior to women. They treat both sexes equally because they take sex into consideration (they “discriminate”—in the nonpejorative sense of “distinguish”—on the basis of sex) precisely in a way that matters: by appreciating the bodily sexual difference of men and women in things such as housing, bathroom, and locker room policy. Would we really be treating men and women equally in anything but an artificial way if we forced men and women, boys and girls, to undress in front of each other? Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in her majority opinion for the Supreme Court forcing the Virginia Military Institute to become co-ed, wrote that it “would undoubtedly require alterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in living arrangements.” Yet we certainly would be treating people unequally if access to intimate facilities were based on factors wholly unrelated to privacy, such as race. As a result, policymakers did not consider sex-specific intimate facilities as discriminatory in the first place, and laws explicitly reflected that commonsense understanding while rightly declaring racially segregated facilities to be unlawful. The lesson here is that not all distinctions in fact should be deemed unlawful discrimination. Not Discriminatory at All If sex-specific intimate facilities are an example of lawful, legitimate policies that take sex into consideration, pro-life medical practices are examples of policies that are legitimate and lawful because they do not take sex into consideration at all. That only women can get pregnant has no bearing whatsoever on the judgment of the conscientious doctor or nurse who refuses to kill the unborn. The insistence of LGBT activists that men actually can become pregnant highlights the point: Pro-life medical personnel refuse to do abortions on pregnant women and “pregnant men” (i.e. women who identify as men). Thus, we can identify three different types of cases: Any proposed policy intended to address the documented needs of people who identify as LGBT must take these categories into account without conflation. SOGI Discrimination: Real and Imagined Consider a florist who refused to serve all customers who identify as LGBT simply because they identified as LGBT. That would be a case of invidious discrimination because the mere knowledge that they identify as LGBT should have no impact whatsoever on the act of the florist selling flowers, because there is no rational connection between the two. Now consider Baronelle Stutzman, the 71-year-old grandmother who served one particular gay customer for nearly a decade but declined to do the wedding flowers for his same-sex wedding ceremony. The customer’s sexual orientation did not play any role in Stutzman’s decision. Her belief that marriage is a union of sexually complementary spouses does not spring from any convictions about people who identify as LGBT. When she says she can do wedding flowers only for true weddings, she makes no distinctions based on sexual orientation at all. This is seen most clearly in the case of Catholic Charities adoption agencies. They decline to place the children entrusted to their care with same-sex couples not because of their sexual orientation, but because of the conviction that children deserve both a mother and a father. That belief—that men and women are not interchangeable, mothers and fathers are not replaceable, the two best dads in the world cannot make up for a missing mom, and the two best moms in the world cannot make up for a missing dad—has absolutely nothing to do with sexual orientation. Catholic Charities does not say that people who identify as LGBT cannot love or care for children; it does not take sexual orientation into consideration at all. Its preference for placing children with mothers and fathers is not an instance of discrimination based on sexual orientation—and the law should not say otherwise. Purported gender identity discrimination presents similar problems. The Washington Post recently reported on a woman who was suing a Catholic hospital for declining to perform a sex reassignment procedure on her that entailed removing her healthy uterus. In that report, the Post captures the conflation of real and imaginary discrimination. “What the rule says is if you provide a particular service to anybody, you can’t refuse to provide it to anyone,” said Sarah Warbelow, the legal director for the Human Rights Campaign. That means a transgender person who shows up at an emergency room with something as basic as a twisted ankle cannot be denied care, as sometimes happens, Warbelow said. That also means if a doctor provides breast reconstruction surgery or hormone therapy, those services cannot be denied to transgender patients seeking them for gender dysphoria, she said. The two examples given, however, differ in significant ways. A hospital that refuses to treat the twisted ankles of people who identify as transgender simply because they identify as transgender would be engaging in invidious discrimination, but a hospital that declines to remove the perfectly healthy uterus of a woman who identifies as a man is not engaging in “gender identity” discrimination. The gender identity of the patient plays no role in the decision-making process: Just as pro-life physicians do not kill unborn babies, regardless of the sex or gender identity of the pregnant person, doctors do not remove healthy uteruses from any patients, regardless of how they identify themselves. As for the Human Rights Campaign spokesperson’s claim that emergency rooms “sometimes” refuse to treat the twisted ankles of transgender patients, there is no evidence—including on their own website—that it or anything similar in fact happens. Furthermore, insofar as this “sometimes happens,” it seems reasonable to think that the media would focus so much attention on it that the hospital would reverse course within hours. It therefore seems highly unlikely that this alleged problem merits a governmental response. Need for Policy Shapes the Nature of Policy Response, Definitions, and Protections My new Heritage report argues that any justified government policy must not penalize valid forms of action and interaction or burden the rights of conscience, religion, and speech. We can see this principle in action. Because there was such widespread, entrenched systemic and institutional racism throughout American society in the 1960s, for example, and because social and market forces were not sufficient to remedy the problem, it was appropriate for government to respond. That response was properly tailored to meet this need. It defined discrimination to include racially segregated accommodations, places of employment, and housing providers while providing thin religious liberty protections. Because the justification for antidiscrimination laws based on race was so strong and the need was so great, the law was appropriately broad with limited exemptions. By contrast, consider laws that address discrimination based on sex. Because the nature of sex and the history of sexism did not represent an exact parallel to racism, the law did not treat them in entirely the same ways. Discrimination was legally defined so as not to include sex-specific intimate facilities, and much broader—and in some cases total—religious liberty exemptions were included. And to this day, sex is not a protected class for federal antidiscrimination law as applied to public accommodations. In sum, because the justification for laws against sex-based discrimination was weaker than the justification for laws against race-based discrimination, the legal response was more modest: It covered less terrain, defined discrimination more narrowly, and provided greater protection for religious liberty. Any proposed policies intended to meet the needs of people who identify as LGBT would need to be crafted in a similar manner. Without greater evidence of the justification for specific policy responses—greater documentation of what the needs truly are—it is hard to be specific. In general, however, the need clearly seems weaker than the need for policies designed to deal with discrimination on the basis of race and sex. A policy response would therefore need to cover less ground, target discrimination more narrowly, define discrimination accurately, and avoid undermining the rights of conscience, religion, and speech. Alas, laws proposed by liberals today do not do this."},

Now pollsters and politicians alike are scrambling to figure out what Americans really think about bathrooms and privacy. CNN quickly released a poll with the headline proclaiming that “6-in-10 Oppose Bills Like the North Carolina Transgender Bathroom Law,” a bill intended to maintain gender-specific restrooms until a transgender person takes steps to change his or her sex on his or her birth certificate. But other polls found very different results on the same topic. Both Gallup and New York Times/CBS News polls found that the majority of people thought transgender individuals should use the bathroom corresponding to their birth gender. So what happened? Did America change its mind in just a week? Gallup Editor-in-Chief Frank Newport theorized that the difference in wording and question structure might be the cause of the noticeable swing in the polling results. Newport believes the following could have swayed CNN’s results: Here’s what the CNN poll said: The Gallup and New York Times/CBS polls looked more alike. Gallup’s read: And the New York Times/CBS poll read: What would happen if you adjusted some of these factors that Newport pointed out? Would the results come out the same? The American Perceptions Initiative, a market research initiative of The Heritage Foundation, decided to find out. We didn’t use the split-sample design Gallup mentions, which means factors like time elapsed between the polls could be partly to blame for any differences. But we did use the same platform CNN used—ORC International, which runs regular surveys for clients like CNN using nationally representative samples—and maintained the original format of the question, to keep everything as constant as possible. We changed the wording to make clear to respondents what facilities could be impacted, as well as who would be given access, since the understanding of terms like “transgender” can differ and some of the controversy behind these laws was caused by the sheer breadth of people encompassed. Within a few short weeks, debate had moved away from what North Carolina had done—essentially maintaining the status quo—toward Obama’s recent educational mandate, which required access for transgender students to opposite sex facilities in schools. We adjusted the language to reflect the changes that had occurred in the policy sphere: We found pretty big differences. The results show that 62 percent oppose laws that would give biological men, who self-identify as female, access to female facilities, while just 38 percent support it. That’s almost opposite of what CNN originally found. In the CNN version, just 38 percent supported the “born as” bathroom option, while a majority, 57 percent, supported the “identify as” bathroom option. In our revised version, 62 percent, an even larger majority, now supported the “born as” bathroom option. Differences could of course be affected by intervening events such as Obama’s mandate, which could be seen by some as premature and officious, or other factors. However, it’s clear that some prominent polling headlines on this topic—such as The Washington Post’s “First Major Poll on ‘Bathroom Bills’ Is Good News for Transgender Advocates”—didn’t paint the full picture. * The Gallup and New York Times response options were rotated, meaning the order of the two options was randomly switched across respondents to prevent order bias."},
{"title": "Parents Beware!", "author": ["Rebecca  Hagelin"], "date": "Feb 11, 2005 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/marriage-and-family/commentary/parents-beware", "takeaways": [], "text": "Parents, does the school your children attend feature a sex-education program that's billed as \"abstinence-based\" or \"abstinence-plus\"? If so, you may be under the understandable impression that it tells teens, in clear-cut language, that they're not ready for sex. That they should wait. That it focuses on … well, abstinence.\n\nBut a major study from The Heritage Foundation, \"Comprehensive Sex Education vs. Authentic Abstinence: A Study of Competing Curricula,\" shows that isn't the case. Like \"People for the American Way\" or \"Planned Parenthood,\" the label \"abstinence-plus\" is a flat-out lie. There's a lot of \"plus\" and precious little \"abstinence.\"\n\nContraception is discussed ad nauseam. \"Condoms are available at any drugstore or family planning clinic,\" teens are told in one program, absurdly titled Reducing the Risk. \"They may also be available in outdoor or all-night condom vending machines. Anyone can buy condoms, regardless of age, and no prescription is needed.\" Not exactly the message most parents want presented to their judgment-impaired teens. Yet, as the Heritage study shows, such messages are commonplace in \"comprehensive\" sex-ed programs.\n\nWorse, the programs often rely on role-playing games that are plainly designed to reinforce immoral behavior and break down the natural modesty that might otherwise keep many teens from engaging in pre-marital sex. In Becoming a Responsible Teen (another eye-rolling misnomer), students are given the following scenario: \"My partner and I are alone. We've been leading up to sex for a couple of weeks. The only thing we haven't discussed is protection. My partner needs to persuade me to use a latex condom.\"\n\nWell, this parent has a different suggestion: Things shouldn't even get this far, but if they do, one of the kids needs to say a firm no. When will that be taught?\n\nNot surprisingly, some of these programs also present homosexuality as just another \"lifestyle choice\" that's above reproach. In Be Proud! Be Responsible!, teens are told, \"You can accept your bisexuality.\" In Reducing the Risk, we find this role-playing exercise: \"Tony and Dylan have been to a party and then go to Tony's home to be alone. They start to kiss and undress each other. Dylan reaches into his jacket pocket and realizes that he doesn't have the condom he planned to use. … What can Tony and Dylan do to avoid unprotected sex?\"\n\nAnd that's the tame stuff. From condom \"races\" (seeing which team of students can be the first to successfully unroll one onto a banana or a cucumber) to graphic descriptions of how teens can perform oral sex on each other \"safely,\" these programs are frequently lewd and disgusting. I lack the space (and the stomach, quite frankly) to cite every example, so I'll refer the terminally curious to the Heritage report mentioned earlier.\n\nThe underlying message is unmistakable: Teen sex is normal, so let's just tell the kids how to avoid pregnancy and disease. There's a token nod or two to abstinence, but as Heritage's Robert Rector notes, it often amounts to a sentence or two amid pages and pages of explicit, pro-condom propaganda. Teens get the impression that abstinence is some unattainable ideal -- not the only option that's fail safe (not to mention moral).\n\nYou probably need little proof that parents want such pornography kept far from their kids, but a Zogby International poll of more than 1,000 parents of school-age children provides some: 91 percent said they want teens taught that \"sex should be linked to love, intimacy, and commitment, and that these qualities are most likely to occur in marriage.\" In overwhelming numbers, they rejected the morally objectionable content and approach of \"abstinence-plus\" programs.\n\nAsked when sexual activity should begin, more than three out of every four parents said teens should wait until they're married or close to marriage. Another 12 percent said to wait until they've at least finished high school. Only 7 percent said \"protected sex\" in high school is OK. Yet that's almost exclusively what these programs teach our teens.\n\nWhich means that we're setting them up for failure. A host of social-science research shows that early sexual activity is dangerous not just because of STDs, but because it hampers the ability to form stable marriages later in life (making the additional $38 million President Bush has proposed for abstinence-only programs a sound investment).\n\nParents, your teens deserve an unambiguous abstinence message. If your school isn't providing one, you need to equip yourself with reliable research, network with other parents and make a change. It's time to subtract the \"plus\" from \"abstinence-plus.\" Rebecca Hagelin is a vice president of the Heritage Foundation."},
{"title": "Monogamy, Exclusivity and Permanence?", "author": ["Ryan T. Anderson, Ph.D."], "date": "Dec 13, 2012 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/marriage-and-family/commentary/monogamy-exclusivity-and-permanence", "takeaways": [], "text": "Yesterday’s post explained government’s policy interest in marriage. Government needs to get marriage policy right, because it shapes the norms associated with this most fundamental relationship. Redefining marriage would abandon the norm of male-female sexual complementarity as an essential characteristic of marriage. Making that optional would also make other essential characteristics—like monogamy, exclusivity and permanency—optional, as my co-authors and I argue in our new book, What Is Marriage? Man and Woman: A Defense. We also show how it is increasingly confirmed by the rhetoric and arguments of those who would redefine marriage (“revisionists”) and by the policies that their more candid leaders increasingly embrace. Indeed, several commentators on Tuesday’s post explicitly jettisoned monogamy, sexual exclusivity and pledged permanence as demands of marriage. Consider the norm of monogamy. In testifying before Congress against the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), prominent New York University professor Judith Stacey expressed hope that the revisionist view’s triumph would give marriage “varied, creative and adaptive contours . . . [leading some to] question the dyadic limitations of Western marriage and seek . . . small group marriages.” In their statement “Beyond Same-Sex Marriage,” more than 300  self-styled LGBT and allied scholars and advocates—including prominent Ivy League professors—call for legally recognizing sexual relationships involving more than two partners. University of Calgary professor Elizabeth Brake argues in her book Minimizing Marriage that justice requires using legal recognition to “denormalize the ideal of heterosexual monogamy” and correct for “past discrimination against homosexuals, bisexuals, polygamists and care networks.” And exclusivity? Andrew Sullivan, who has extolled the “spirituality” of “anonymous sex,” writes in his book Virtually Normal that the “openness” of same-sex relationships could enhance the bonds of husbands and wives: Similarly, in a New York Times Magazine profile titled “Married, With Infidelities”, Dan Savage encourages spouses to adopt “a more flexible attitude” about allowing each other to seek sex outside their marriage. A piece titled “Monogamish” in The Advocate, a gay-interest newsmagazine, supports this point still more candidly: As the article’s blurb reads: “We often protest when homophobes insist that same-sex marriage will change marriage for straight people too. But in some ways, they’re right.” These are the words of leading supporters of same-sex marriage. If you believe in monogamy and exclusivity—and the benefits these bring to orderly procreation and child wellbeing—but would redefine civil marriage, take note. Some revisionists have embraced the goal of weakening the institution of marriage in these very terms. Former President George W. Bush “is correct,” says lesbian journalist Victoria Brownworth in “Something Borrowed, Something Blue: Is Marriage Right for Queers?” “when he states that allowing same-sex couples to marry will weaken the institution of marriage. . . . It most certainly will do so, and that will make marriage a far better concept than it previously has been.” Professor Ellen Willis writing in The Nation celebrates the fact that “conferring the legitimacy of marriage on homosexual relations will introduce an implicit revolt against the institution into its very heart.” Gay radio host Michelangelo Signorile in Out magazine urged those in same-sex relationships to “demand the right to marry not as a way of adhering to society’s moral codes but rather to debunk a myth and radically alter an archaic institution.” They should “fight for same-sex marriage and its benefits and then, once granted, redefine the institution of marriage completely, because the most subversive action lesbians and gay men can undertake . . . is to transform the notion of ‘family’ entirely.” The world’s limited experience so far suggests that these ideas play out in policy. Since countries have begun recognizing same-sex unions, officials have proposed bills, made administrative decisions or allowed lawsuits challenging nearly every other traditional norm: Mexico City considered expressly temporary marriage licenses. A federal judge in Utah allowed a legal challenge to anti-bigamy laws. A public notary in Brazil recognized a triad as a civil union, saying in almost so many words that the redefinition of marriage required it: “The move reflected the fact that the idea of a ‘family’ had changed. . . . ‘For better or worse, it doesn’t matter, but what we considered a family before isn’t necessarily what we would consider a family today.’ ” The New York Times recently reported on a study finding that exclusivity was not the norm among gay partners: “‘With straight people, it’s called affairs or cheating,’ said Colleen Hoff, the study’s principal investigator, ‘but with gay people it does not have such negative connotations.’” In proponents’ own words, redefining marriage would make individuals less likely to abide by marital norms—precisely the concern that led to the marriage movement in the first place. But as yesterday’s post showed, the state has an interest in marriage and marital norms because these serve the public good: protecting child wellbeing, civil society and limited government. Government policy addresses male-female sexual relationships in a way it does not address other relationships because these alone produce new human beings. For highly dependent infants, there is no path to physical, moral and cultural maturity—no path to personal responsibility—without a long and delicate process of ongoing care and supervision. Unless children do mature, they never will become healthy, upright, productive members of society. Marriage exists to make men and women responsible to each other and any children they might have. And marital norms serve these same ends. The norms of monogamy and sexual exclusivity encourage childbearing within a context that makes it most likely children will be raised by their mom and dad. These norms also help ensure shared responsibility and commitment between spouses, sufficient attention from both parents to their children, and avoid the sexual and kinship jealously that might otherwise be present. The norm of permanency ensures that children will at least be cared for by their mother and father until they reach maturity. It also provides kinship structure for the interaction across the generations, as elderly parents are cared for by their adult children and help care for their grandkids, without the complications of fragmented step-families. Again, if you believe in monogamy and exclusivity—and the benefits these bring to orderly procreation and child wellbeing—but would redefine civil marriage, take note."},
{"title": "Anti-First Amendment Bill Poses Imminent Threat in California", "author": ["Monica  Burke"], "date": "Apr 24, 2018 ", "url": "https://www.heritage.org/civil-society/commentary/anti-first-amendment-bill-poses-imminent-threat-california", "takeaways": [], "text": "A new bill in California claims to protect LGBT people, but actually limits their choices, censors speech, and infringes upon religious freedom. AB 2943 would amend the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act—a consumer law that outlaws unfair and deceptive practices—by adding so-called “sexual orientation change efforts” to a list of banned practices. It would in effect ban all practices that the state deems attempting to change one’s sexual orientation—including practices as indirect as the publishing of certain material. This expansive law would impose widespread censorship that could implicate authors, speakers, counselors, colleges and universities, and even religious leaders seeking to address unwanted same-sex attraction or gender identity confusion. The bill defines sexual change efforts as “any practices that seek to change an individual’s sexual orientation. This includes efforts to change behaviors or gender expressions, or to eliminate or reduce sexual romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.” This broad terminology that includes not only attractions, but actions, has drastic implications. The proposed bill could infringe upon the constitutionally protected speech of countless people. If the bill becomes law, it could punish the speech of religious leaders who preach chastity and, according to the teachings of their religion, maintain that sexual activity should be limited to marriage between one man and one woman. It could also punish religiously-affiliated counseling services who counsel patients who do not wish to act upon their same-sex attraction for legitimate personal reasons—for example, someone who wants to live by the teachings of their religion on sexuality or to remain faithful to their spouse and children. It could punish speakers like Ryan T. Anderson of The Heritage Foundation when speaking in California to advocate a traditional view of marriage and human sexuality. It could punish bookstores, including online platforms like Amazon, that sell recently published books that challenge gender identity ideology, like Anderson’s latest, “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment.” It could also punish religious colleges and universities that maintain codes of conduct requiring students to live consistent with biblical views about sexuality. This law would be triggered when a transaction occurs—a counselor’s payment, an attendance fee, the cost of a book, or a pastor’s speaking fee. Anyone who is offended by a statement, teaching, or practice with regard to sexual orientation and gender identity could then file a lawsuit against a minister, counselor, author, store, or educational institution that offended them. A lawsuit could devastate any of these persons or institutions. First, the accused would be at the mercy of a judge to determine whether or not AB 2943 applies in their case. The California Consumer Legal Remedies Act commands that it be “liberally construed and applied.” By this standard, individuals and institutions would be vulnerable to crippling fines simply for speaking to millennia-old views on human sexuality. Even if a judge were to spare accused persons from frivolous claims, AB 2943 would still have a chilling effect, as individuals and institutions begin to censor their own speech in order to avoid undergoing multiple costly lawsuits. This places a burden on the free exercise of religion, too. If individuals or organizations cannot preach the faith-based response to same-sex attraction and gender identity, they cannot freely practice their religion. Ultimately, AB 2943 treats faith-driven activity to counsel chastity as fraudulent and deceptive, directly violating Justice Anthony Kennedy’s admonition in Obergefell that “religious organizations and persons [be] given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths.” Such an assault on free exercise hurts everyone. Civil liberties travel together, and when we set a precedent for the government to silence certain viewpoints in one context, we should fully expect to see censorship arise in other areas. The broad nature of AB 2943 also fails to consider those LGBT individuals who may seek help in their efforts to refrain from acting on certain inclinations. These individuals would be denied professional and personal help under AB 2943. The policy would also affect transgender persons who later cease identifying with the opposite sex and wish to transition back to their biological gender. Under AB 2943, such individuals would be categorically denied the help and support they desire. AB 2943 poses an imminent threat to civil liberties in California. It does little to protect LGBT persons and only limits the number of perspectives (and assistance) they have access to, while setting a dangerous, Orwellian precedent for government-mandated censorship. Policymakers must act quickly before the bill can be signed into law."},

In 2007, Boston Children’s Hospital “became the first major program in the United States to focus on transgender children and adolescents,” as its website brags. A decade later, more than 45 pediatric gender clinics have opened their doors to our nation’s children. Parents are told that puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones may be the only way to prevent their children from committing suicide. Never mind that the best studies of gender dysphoria show that between 80 and 95 percent of children who express a discordant gender identity will come to identify with their bodily sex if natural development is allowed to proceed. Never mind that “transitioning” treatment has not been shown to reduce the extraordinarily high rate of suicide attempts among people who identify as transgender (41 percent, compared with 4.6 percent of the general population). Never mind that people who have had transition surgery are 19 times more likely to die by suicide. These statistics should be enough to halt the headlong rush into “transitioning” and prompt us to find more effective ways to prevent these tragic outcomes. Most of all, we shouldn’t be encouraging children to “transition,” or making heroes and role models of those who have done so. We should be tolerant—indeed, loving—toward those who struggle with their gender identity, but also be aware of the harm done to the common good, particularly to children, when transgender identity is normalized. Transgender activists are not merely asking for tolerance or kindness. They are demanding affirmation, not just from adults but from children and adolescents who are already challenged by the normal process of sexual development. In a culture where transgender identities are not only affirmed but celebrated, everyone will be compelled to construct their own gender identity, unaided by a common understanding of sex differences and why they matter. In my new book “When Harry Became Sally: Responding to the Transgender Moment,” I show that the best biology, psychology, and philosophy all support an understanding of sex as a bodily reality, and an understanding of gender as a social manifestation of bodily sex. Biology isn’t bigotry. A sound understanding of gender rejects sex stereotypes on the one hand and androgyny on the other. The virtuous mean is a view of gender that reveals meaningful sex differences and communicates the difference they make—a view that takes sex differences seriously while upholding the fundamental equality of the sexes as complements to one another. The most helpful therapies do not try to remake the body to conform with thoughts and feelings—which is impossible—but rather to help people find healthy ways to manage their tension and move toward accepting the reality of their bodily selves. My book provides a nuanced view of our sexed embodiment, a balanced approach to policy issues involving transgender identity and gender more broadly, and a sober and honest survey of the human costs of getting human nature wrong."}
