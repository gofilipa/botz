{"title": "A More Effective Way To Confront China’s Growing Aggression", "text": ["One of the central weaknesses of the Biden administration’s national security policies was its reliance on the concept of “integrated deterrence” to prevent aggressive actions by the People’s Republic of China.", "The strategy entailed building robust alliances in the Indo-Pacific, forward-deploying greater numbers of U.S. military assets to the region, and a tighter integration of military capabilities across the full spectrum of warfare.", "But this approach only works if the United States can also credibly wage and win a war against China and prevent its regional and global military ambitions. In this respect, the Biden administration was far less successful.", "There are four major areas the Trump administration should focus on to make deterrence as well as U.S. war-fighting strategies more successful.", "The military challenge of China is an order of magnitude greater than any military threat the United States has ever faced. Over the last decade, it has consistently increased its military budget by 7% every year—far more than the United States—and has dramatically grown its military forces in every respect.", "It now fields the largest navy in the world and the largest missile force on the planet. Similarly, the PRC is the world’s fastest growing nuclear power, and today fields more tactical weapons in Asia than does the United States. All of this is part of China’s strategy to deter and, if necessary, deny any potential U.S. military actions within the region.", "Due to these developments, the United States must grow the size of its military overall—to include conventional forces relevant to deterring Chinese aggression, such as ships, combat aircraft, and logistical support systems—and aggressively address retention and recruiting problems across the force.", "The second area requiring attention is the “missile gap” between the munitions available in U.S. inventories and those required to successfully prosecute U.S. war plans against China. While many of these munitions have been used in the war in Ukraine and in operations in the Middle East, the paucity of industrial capacity to build required munitions on a scale necessary for a future possible conflict is alarming.", "While some production lines have been opened in response to war-fighting requirements in Ukraine and some procurement orders have been given multi-year contracts, more must be done. Similarly, the ability to build additional conventional capabilities while also refitting and refurbishing existing platforms is also disturbingly low. Reindustrializing U.S. military infrastructure should be a priority for the Trump administration.", "The third area requiring greater attention is preparing for the mass mobilization of reservists if war with China were to break out. A significant portion of existing active-duty weapons platforms require reserve help in order for them to work and deploy.", "Existing reserve centers lack sufficient personnel to process such a large mobilization and the services vary in their ability to track former reserve members, who may also need to be called up, in the event of large-scale conflict. Further, many reservists also work in industries necessary for war so a focused look at the implications of full-scale mobilization also needs to be undertaken.", "The final area requiring greater attention is closely examining how a full decoupling of the U.S. and Chinese markets would look like in a war time environment. Far too many components, parts, and even rare earth elements are controlled or influenced by the PRC and its government-controlled companies. In a war-time scenario, the absence of these crucial items could prove disastrous to the war-fighting ability of the United States.", "A credible policy of deterrence can only exist if the ability to wage and win a war against an opponent is also viable. This can only be done through the growth of U.S. military forces, addressing significant munition shortfalls, making sure reservists can be mobilized at scale and quickly, and that U.S. military capabilities can continue to fight if access to the Chinese market is curtailed.", "The Trump administration needs to focus on rebuilding the war-fighting abilities of the United States to make America safe again. If not, catastrophe could await our armed forces."]},
{"title": "The United States Is at Risk of a Spanish-Style Electricity Meltdown", "text": ["Spain declared a state of emergency earlier this week after the country’s electricity supply went down, due to cascading failures blamed on possible faults in two solar plants in the country’s southwest region. Americans should not be complacent, however. The same could happen in the United States, too.", "Spain has been ramping up solar power for years, and set a record of meeting nearly 80 per cent of demand on April 21. On April 28, the day of the meltdown, solar provided 59 per cent of electricity, wind about 12 per cent, and nuclear and gas approximately 22 per cent.", "But providing reliable electricity to people with intermittent renewables, such as wind and solar, is more difficult than with baseload power, such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear power. In a 2024 report, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), a nonprofit international regulatory authority, warned of high and elevated risks of shortages for much of the United States from 2025 to 2029.", "According to the report, electricity supplies are likely to be inadequate as coal and some gas-fired generators face retirement and energy demand surges due to data center and artificial intelligence technology. The NERC authors stated: “The trends point to critical reliability challenges facing the industry: satisfying escalating energy growth, managing generator retirements, and accelerating resource and transmission development.”", "The Midcontinent Independent System Operator, which provides electricity for 15 states from Louisiana to Wisconsin, as well as the Canadian province of Manitoba, is at high risk of suffering a shortage of electricity in the high demand months of summer and winter, for instance.", ", signed into law in 2022 by Joe Biden in the Inflation Reduction Act, are at the heart of the problem. The wind and the sun are effectively free sources of energy, but they don’t blow and shine continuously. Continuous, dense power from gas, coal, and nuclear is needed as a backup for renewables. But since these do not get subsidies, there is less incentive for companies to invest in them.", "The Solar Energy Industries Association states that solar energy represents “energy dominance”. It argues that the tax credit for solar is “one of the most important federal policy mechanisms to support the growth of solar energy in the United States” and has provided “critical stability for businesses and investors”.", "After ", ", Spaniards may beg to differ. In the United States, oil, gas, and coal have no tax breaks in the Inflation Reduction Act, and these forms of energy are currently vital to keep solar and wind in operation.", "The danger of potential blackouts is the reason that Donald Trump declared an energy emergency on his first day in office. He is taking several steps to avert the disaster forecast in the NERC report. These steps could also be emulated by the UK and the EU if they wanted to ensure a reliable grid.", "They don’t seem keen to follow suit, however. Coincidentally, or not, following the Spanish meltdown, a new report by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change was published stating that “any strategy based on either ‘phasing out’ fossil fuels in the short term or limiting consumption is a strategy doomed to fail”. But despite the chaos on the Iberian peninsula, the Institute’s sensible recommendations were evidently deemed unpopular by Labour Party leadership.", "President Trump, meanwhile, has asked the Environmental Protection Agency to end its Biden-era rules that would have required coal-fired and new natural gas-fired power plants to close if they could not eliminate 90 per cent of the CO2 emissions. He has also requested Congress to get rid of the billions in subsidies for renewables and other clean energy credits in the Inflation Reduction Act scheduled for the next decade. The combination of ending the subsidies for renewables and keeping open existing power plants should avert the blackouts forecast in the NERC report.", "President Trump is going further by accelerating development of fossil fuel projects. He has reopened Alaska to oil development, and is fast-tracking permitting for fossil fuel projects, so approvals come in 28 days or fewer. He has asked the Environmental Protection Agency to reconsider the finding that greenhouse gases such as CO2 and methane are pollutants. He has ordered the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and other associated UN agreements, a process that takes a year.", "The real winner from renewable energy use is China, which dominates wind and solar manufacturing. China makes around 75 per cent of the world’s batteries, used in electric vehicles and to back up solar arrays. The tariffs that President Trump is placing on China, as well as removal of the tax credits, should tilt American energy policy in a more resilient direction.", "The stability and reliability of the power grid cannot depend on subsidized renewables. It is crucial to maintain continuous, dense power from coal, natural gas, or nuclear energy to ensure a dependable electricity supply. The steps taken by President Trump to avert blackouts by promoting fossil fuel development and reconsidering emissions rules reflect a necessary response to the challenges highlighted in the NERC report. The Spanish disaster proves it."]},

Hang American small business owners out to dry, or lock in a tax system that allows America’s entrepreneurs to thrive?", "That’s the question Congress must answer when deciding whether to renew critical expiring provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).", "Passed by Congress less than a year into President Donald Trump’s first term, TCJA implemented tax cuts, structural reforms and simplifications that helped produce the booming American economy of 2018 and 2019. The results? 50-year unemployment lows and rapid gains in median household income – prosperity that would have continued apace if not for COVID-19 and the ensuing massive glut of federal spending.", "But if TCJA is allowed to expire at the end of the year, nobody will be hit harder than small businesses.", "Before TCJA, flaws in the tax code discouraged businesses from investing in machinery and equipment by not allowing them to fully deduct those costs in the year they made those investments.", "Instead, the tax code spread out those deductions for five, seven, 10, 15 or 20 years—an eternity for a small business owner scraping by with tiny profit margins and limited access to credit.", "This kind of system would be especially harmful in the high-inflation environment that’s resulted from the breakneck pace of federal spending during the early 2020s. By the time deductions for machinery and equipment could be fully claimed, inflation could wipe out much of those deductions’ value.", "It makes no sense to have a tax code that penalizes business owners for investing in their factories, workers and communities. But that flawed, old system has been phasing back in for the past three years and will return in full force in January if Congress doesn’t act.", "Small startup tech companies—which spend heavily on research and experimental costs—face a similar situation.", "Since 2022, they’ve had to delay 90% of many research-related deductions to a later tax year, including deductions related to employee compensation, material and supplies, the cost of obtaining a patent, and other valid business expenses. How are these small businesses supposed to innovate, scale up and compete with existing big tech companies when the tax code punishes them for doing so?", "Since TCJA’s passage, it has helped shield family businesses like farms and ranches from a devastating 40% federal tax on assets passed down to family members.", "In general, death taxes especially hurt asset-rich and cash-poor businesses. Most of the value of a ranch or farm is in the land, structures, machinery and cattle. It’s not sitting in a bank. Grieving family members shouldn’t be forced to grapple with whether to literally sell the farm to pay a severe double tax.", "But, if TCJA provisions are allowed to expire, the death tax will expand—meaning the death of many family businesses.", "Millions of small business owners benefited from the 20% pass-through deduction (known as Section 199A), which is set to expire at the end of the year. It had a larger impact on the amount of taxes paid by entrepreneurs and small business owners than anything else in TCJA. While this provision can certainly be reformed or improved, simply letting the provision lapse would slam Main Street businesses hard.", "The TCJA’s small business tax provisions have been in place for nearly eight years, over which time much has transpired—including the rise of new taxes, spending and regulations. Over that same period, thousands of small businesses were crushed by COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions.", "Now is not the time to pull the rug out from under those that remain. At a time where faith in American institutions is critically low, small businesses are one of the only institutions that Americans of all stripes still widely trust.", "Extending TCJA isn’t about slashing taxes for corporations, as some might mischaracterize what’s at stake. In fact, corporate taxes would only rise modestly if TCJA expires. Rather, extending the business provisions in TCJA is about avoiding an unprecedented tax hike that would hammer small businesses, main street, workers and the American economy."]},

Lower tax rates\nlead to more jobs and higher incomes-which in turn generates more\ntax money. Famed Harvard University economics professor Martin\nFeldstein predicts that, once this \"supply-side\" effect is taken\ninto account, the real size of the tax cut falls to a little over\n$1 trillion.", "But let's assume a worst-case scenario: that not only will the\ntax cut use up the full $1.6 trillion, but Congress will squander\nanother $1 trillion on government programs. Pulling out our trusty\ncalculators, we add these two figures together, subtract them from\nthe $5.6 trillion surplus, and we're left with $3 trillion.", "This brings us back to the assertion that tax cuts somehow will\nprevent lawmakers from fixing Social Security. Sticking with our\nworst-case scenario, is $3 trillion enough money to save Social\nSecurity?", "The answer is a resounding yes. As a matter of fact, it wouldn't\nmatter if the surplus disappeared overnight. Social Security reform\nis not, at its core, a general budget issue. It's a demographic\nissue: The old-age system needs to be updated with personal\nretirement accounts to keep it from going bust.", "Under current projections, Social Security is expected to\naccumulate a deficit of at least $21 trillion between 2015 and\n2075. Personal accounts can substantially reduce that unfunded\nliability, since many workers would no longer need to rely on\nmonthly checks from the government.", "This explains why Social Security reform doesn't depend on\nwhether we have a surplus today. Having $3 trillion in surplus\nrevenue would help, of course. It could be used to guarantee full\nbenefits to current retirees and older workers while permitting\nyounger workers to join a better system.", "But a surplus is a convenience, not a necessity. Dozens of\ncountries around the world have shifted to personal retirement\naccounts-many of them at a time when they were not running a\nsurplus.

Yes, it may cost a little money\nin the beginning to ensure full benefits for retirees, much as a\nfamily might pay \"points\" and other closing costs to get a new\nmortgage. But taxpayers will save a huge amount of money when\nSocial Security becomes self-financing, just as families can lower\ntheir long-term costs with lower-rate mortgages.", "In the final analysis, though, Social Security reform is not\nabout numbers.

Trump wields more weapons than most of the world’s armies combined. Modern warriors maul each other with multifaceted economies, webs of diplomacy and influencers from outer space to digital space.

Hedgehogs view the world through the lens of single-guiding idea. Foxes draw on wide variety of influences, experiences and knowledge. As applied to strategy, these worldviews can take the world to very different places.", "At its core, strategy is “the” simple idea. It has been around for a long time. Readers can find it buried somewhere in Clausewitz’s several hundred pages ", " (1832).  However, as Clausewitz noted: war is simple, but in war the simple is “very difficult.”", "The simple part is what rightly makes up what ought to be called strategy. Strategy-making at its most basic accounts for three interrelated decisions: ends, ways and means.  Ends are the goals; the objectives the strategy is tasked to achieve. In World War II, for example, the Allies described their war aims as the unconditional surrender of the Axis powers (Germany, Italy and Japan).", "Ways are how the ends are to be met.

Of course, the armed forces were a big part of that, but means also included all the national assets mobilized to support the war effort: from Rosy the Riveter on the factory floor of a Boeing assembly plant, to artists in Disney studios making military training films.", "A strategy is inadequate unless it interconnects and answers all three questions: what, how and with what?", "There is, of course, more to strategy than just picking the answers to three questions like order off a Chinese menu. Napoleon made choices. He decided the best course for maintaining his mastery of Europe was an invasion of Russia.  It was a bold decision. It was also a bad one. The 1812 invasion proved a disastrous option that cost him his empire.", "Clausewitz’s scholarship, his contemporaries, and many military writers that followed all were animated by describing the means to avoid such catastrophic calls themselves and inflict Napoleon’s fate on their own enemies. Everyone started adding instructions to the manual until war became too complicated for mere mortals.", "But the basics of strategy haven’t been much improved upon. Strategy requires a sober evaluation. Is it suitable, feasible and acceptable—not just a hard choice, but one that has a chance of prevailing? This is a test to assess if the strategy is at least logically consistent.", "The first measure is if the strategy is suitable—in other words, would the strategy satisfy the policy aims?  Feasibility is a judgment of whether the strategy could actually be accomplished with the means available. Acceptability assesses the commitment to follow through and accomplish the strategy.", "Satisfying all three judgments is no guarantor of victory. There is no secret sauce for winning wars. After all, the enemy gets a vote. The people supporting the war get a vote. Still, strategy guided by a logic that satisfies competing demands is the best assurance leaders can hope for in the messy world of war.", "Gaddis summed up the test even more simply: In great matters of strategy, aspirations should never exceed the capacity to fulfill them.", "That’s not to say that great war-makers shouldn’t be filled to the brim with dash, bravado, vision and confidence.

For that alone, Camp and the staff of the Ways and Means Committee deserve much praise. Tax reform is a vital component of the economic policy reforms that are necessary to restore the United States to prosperity.", "Tax reform should be a top issue for Congress because the current tax system is like an albatross around the neck of the U.S. economy, holding it back from reaching its full potential. When the economy cannot grow as fast it could, all Americans suffer because there are fewer opportunities, fewer jobs, and lower wages. Congress has not reformed the tax code since 1986, and much damage has been done in the intervening 28 years. The tax code is long overdue for fundamental reform.", "The current tax system is damaging the economy. On the individual side, the rates levied on work, saving, investment, and entrepreneurship—all basic elements of economic growth—are too high. The top federal income tax rate is 43.4 percent. When combined with state income taxes, this means that taxpayers in many states pay a marginal rate in excess of 50 percent, a major deterrent to engaging in economically productive activities.", "Businesses pay tax on the income they earn, and individuals then pay a second layer of tax on capital gains or dividends when businesses distribute those earnings. This double tax further diminishes the amount of savings and investment in the economy.", "The current system also picks winners and losers by providing tax preferences to politically favored activities, such as purchasing energy-efficient products or vehicles. The tax system should play no role in tilting markets.", "On the business side, the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. In addition, we are essentially the only country that taxes our businesses on the income they earn in other countries.", " Moreover, the U.S. delays deductions for investment in equipment and factories much longer than most industrialized countries. Businesses should be able to deduct costs when they are incurred. These three policy mistakes significantly impair the ability of U.S. businesses to compete in the highly competitive global market.", "Fundamental tax reform would correct all of these problems, enabling the economy to grow to its potential and resulting in increased opportunity for Americans at all income levels.", "The problems with the current tax system arise largely because, in addition to the high rates it levies, it uses a faulty tax base. The tax base is what the tax code taxes; income and consumption are the most common tax bases. A consumption (or consumed-income) base is preferable to an income tax because it prevents the double taxation of investment—a key factor if a tax system is to have the least negative impact on economic growth. The current system uses a hybrid of an income and consumed-income base, creating many instances of double taxation and reducing investment.", "Fundamental tax reform would start by deciding which tax base to use. Consumption, or consumed income, is by far the best in terms of promoting prosperity and fairness. Then the new tax code, assuming a consumed-income base, would have the deductions needed to maintain neutrality, including deductions for savings and interest expenses", " and for the maintenance of a strong civil society—i.e., charitable giving. At the same time, the new tax code would levy a rate necessary for raising the revenue to fund the federal government’s constitutional functions.", "The rate that such a fundamental tax reform plan would levy would likely be substantially lower than today’s tax rates. The Heritage Foundation’s New Flat Tax follows this approach and has significantly lower rates,", " as do other broad-based consumption taxes such as the original flat tax,", " national sales tax,", " or business transfer tax.", "Instead of fundamental reform, Chairman Camp chose another approach: to improve the current system as much as possible and minimize its negative impact on the economy. Such an approach generally requires lowering rates and broadening the tax base. Although it will not result in as much economic growth as fundamental reform, this approach can result in a system that is less of a burden on the economy if enough improvements are made.", "This approach usually forces policymakers into trade-offs that must balance pro-growth reforms with reforms that move in the opposite direction, thereby subduing its economic benefits. These trade-offs are especially pronounced when one works within the confines of static revenue neutrality as Chairman Camp did.", "Revenue neutrality holds that the reformed tax code will raise the same amount of revenue as the current tax system. This is a sensible political constraint and is understandable when tax revenues are near their historical average as a percentage of the economy. Within the confines of the current tax system, it often means choosing between lowering rates and increasing double taxation or reducing the tax burden on savings and investment but lowering rates only slightly or not at all.", "Using a ", "revenue score further complicates reform. Static revenue neutrality assumes that the contemplated tax reform will have no positive economic effects and therefore necessitates higher tax rates within the reform effort than would be warranted if the real-world positive economic effects of sound tax policies were taken into account. Tax reform would be more effective if, instead of focusing so much on revenue neutrality and replicating the current distribution of the tax burden, it focused more on whether tax reform would make most Americans better off and return our country to prosperity.", "Chairman Camp chose to achieve growth by lowering tax rates and making a few other pro-growth enhancements, requiring him to broaden the tax base to make his reform revenue neutral. By accepting the current flawed base and adhering strictly to static revenue neutrality, he was forced to broaden the tax base in many economically counterproductive ways in order to achieve substantial tax rate reductions.", "The pro-growth changes in the Camp plan are headlined by a reduction in tax rates and the number of statutory tax brackets. The current system has seven tax brackets that range in rates from 10 percent to 39.6 percent. In addition, there is a 3.8 percent Medicare tax on wage and self-employment income over $250,000 ($200,000 for single filers), which also applies to investment income because of Obamacare. As a result, the top rate is 43.4 percent before personal exemption and itemized deduction phaseouts.", "The Camp plan would reduce the top tax rate to 38.8 percent and have three marginal brackets. Taxable incomes up to $71,200 for joint returns ($35,600 for single returns) would be taxed at 10 percent. A 25 percent marginal tax rate would be added for those with taxable incomes greater than these amounts. Finally, an additional 10 percent surtax would be imposed on taxpayers with modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) above $450,000 for joint returns ($400,000 for single returns), creating a third bracket taxed at 35 percent.", " The plan also retains the 3.8 percent Medicare tax on employee wages and self-employment.", " Combining the 35 percent rate and the 3.8 percent Medicare tax results in a 38.8 percent top tax rate.", "The surtax effectively creates a new alternative minimum tax (AMT) for upper-income taxpayers because it applies to MAGI. A wide range of items are added back to calculate MAGI for purposes of the 10 percent surtax, including the standard deduction, all itemized deductions except the deduction for charitable contributions, the foreign earned income exclusion, tax-exempt interest, employer contributions to health plans, defined-contribution retirement plans, and the portion of Social Security benefits excluded from gross income.", "Income that is qualified domestic manufacturing income (QDMI) would not be subject to the 10 percent surtax unless, generally, that income is treated as net earnings from self-employment.", " Taxing retirement savings, municipal bond interest, and employer-provided health insurance could be problematic.", "The top rate would apply to pass-through entities (such as S corporations, LLCs, and partnerships) that do not manufacture. Although the rate they would pay under the Camp proposal is lower than under the current system, these pass-throughs (typically small businesses) would pay a significantly higher rate than businesses that pay the corporate income tax. This would be unfair to these businesses and would create problematic incentives when choosing organizational structures.", "The Camp plan taxes capital gains and dividends at a top rate of 24.8 percent, which is roughly in line with the current rate after accounting for personal exemption and itemized deduction phaseouts. It does so by exempting 40 percent of taxpayers’ capital gains and dividends and then applying their marginal rate to the remainder. It also retains the Obamacare 3.8 percent tax on investment income.", "The Camp plan eliminates many credits and deductions that are unnecessary for tax neutrality, including many alternative energy provisions that only serve to distort the energy market. This is a positive step toward a neutral tax code and one that also reduces complexity. The plan also correctly taxes many forms of income that are excluded from taxable income today.", "Camp eliminates personal exemptions but expands the standard deduction to $22,000 for families and $11,000 for single filers. This would make filing taxes easier for many lower- and some middle-income taxpayers because it would reduce the number of taxpayers who itemize. The Ways and Means Committee estimates that the percentage of taxpayers who itemize would decline from roughly one-third to about 5 percent—a steep decline.", "Camp also eliminates the deduction for state and local taxes. This deduction encourages the growth of state and local governments.", "Elimination of the existing AMT and the consolidation of several tax preferences for higher education would simplify the tax law for many families.", "The increase of overall simplicity would have been even greater had Camp not made other changes that added back complexity for both individuals and businesses. Some of that complexity for individuals arises from the phaseout of tax brackets and credits, which would increase ", " marginal tax rates above the statutory marginal rates for certain income levels.", "For example, the earned income tax credit is phased out for those with incomes greater than $20,000 (single) and $27,000 (joint) at a 19 percent rate. This creates a 29 percent bracket for many with incomes between $20,000 and $48,053.", " The benefit of the 10 percent tax bracket would be phased out by effectively creating a 30 percent tax bracket for those with taxable incomes between $300,000 and $513,600 (joint) and between $250,000 and $356,800 (single).", "Thus, the plan has a patchwork of at least seven different marginal tax rates, often with lower marginal tax rates on those with higher incomes. Despite this complexity, it is still an improvement over the current morass of phaseouts in the code. However, fundamental tax reform would ideally create a code with substantially fewer or no marginal effective rate spikes.", "The plan reduces marginal tax rates on average and would improve incentives for work and risk-taking. Lower rates for lower income levels would also improve work incentives for families.", "The most pro-growth aspects of the Camp plan are its corporate income tax rate reductions and its international tax provisions. The plan would lower what is now the world’s highest rate from 35 percent at the federal level to 25 percent, putting it more in line with the international average. A lower rate would encourage both U.S. and foreign businesses to invest here, resulting in more jobs and higher wages.", "Camp’s move away from the current worldwide system of taxing the foreign income of U.S. businesses would provide an additional and much-needed boost to domestic investment. His plan would institute a dividend-exemption regime that levied a 1.25 percent tax on the foreign income of U.S. businesses. This change from the worldwide system closer to a territorial one would benefit the economy substantially. Camp and the Ways and Means staff deserve a great deal of credit for including this much-needed reform.", "The Camp plan also preserves Section 179 expensing of capital costs by small businesses, allowing them to deduct up to $250,000 in capital costs each year. This is the proper treatment for all investment, reduces small firms’ cost of capital, and aids their cash flow. This is a very positive feature of the Camp plan that should be expanded.", "By making the joint filing income bracket two times the single filing threshold, the Camp plan eliminates the marriage penalty for many Americans. However, the structure of the new earned income tax credit (EITC) would mean that those who are eligible could be subject to a marriage penalty.", " Moreover, the 30 percent bracket caused by the phaseout of the 10 percent bracket benefit means that those with incomes above $250,000 could experience a marriage penalty; the 35 percent bracket (due to the 10 percent surtax) means that those with incomes greater than $400,000 would also probably be subject to a marriage penalty. This result is still better than the marriage penalty under the current system.", "The Camp plan limits the deduction for mortgage interest. In any tax system, if the interest received by the lender is taxable, then the interest paid by the debtor should be deductible.", " Otherwise, the tax system artificially raises the cost of borrowing.", "The Camp plan also substantially increases the tax bias against savings and investment. This aspect of the plan would have a substantial negative impact on economic growth that grows with each passing year.", "Starting in 2017, the Camp plan increases business taxes by dramatically extending the length of the period over which businesses may deduct the cost of buying machinery or equipment and building factories or other structures. The plan also requires the use of straight-line depreciation. This alternative depreciation system (ADS) would very nearly double the recovery period for many assets. These provisions increase business taxes by $270 billion over 10 years (most of which occurs in later years).", "The U.S. capital cost recovery system is already much worse than the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average, and the Camp plan would make it much worse.", " The Camp plan would increase the cost of capital placed in service in the U.S., reduce investment, and lower productivity gains. This reduction in the competitiveness of U.S. businesses would grow over time as the adverse impact of less investment and less modern technology accumulated. The Camp plan would return the U.S. to the type of capital cost recovery system that was in place during the Carter era, before President Ronald Reagan’s Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 corrected the problem by enacting the Accelerated Cost Recovery System.", "Research and experimentation (R&E) expenses by businesses should be deductible as incurred, as should all business expenses, but research is unusually important to innovation and job creation. The Camp plan inexplicably singles out R&E expenditures for adverse treatment. It increases business taxes by $193 billion over 10 years by requiring businesses to deduct these expenses over a five-year period. This adverse treatment is mitigated slightly by retaining the R&E tax credit in modified form. The new R&E credit would reduce federal revenues by $34 billion over 10 years.", "The Camp plan would require that half of advertising expenses be deducted over a 10-year period. This entirely unwarranted provision would deny businesses the ability to deduct their expenses and thus overstate their taxable income. This provision would increase business taxes by $169 billion over 10 years.", "Last-In First-Out (LIFO) accounting for inventories has been a permitted method for inventory accounting since the 1930s.", " It is simple and prevents business from paying tax on phantom inflationary gains on inventories. It should not be repealed, particularly since higher rates of inflation could return in the future. This provision would raise business taxes by $79 billion over 10 years.", "One of the most egregious violations of sound tax policy in the plan is a tax on systemically important financial institutions (SIFI). The tax, better known as a bank tax, would apply to only a few of the largest banks and other financial firms—those with more than $500 billion in assets. The tax would be 0.035 percent on those banks’ assets, assessed quarterly. It would raise more than $86 billion over 10 years. Sound tax policy does not single out particular businesses in certain industries for extra taxation. If there are issues arising because of how other laws affect these banks, those issues should be addressed outside of the tax code.", "To achieve growth, the economic benefit that comes from the good policy of lowering tax rates must trump the damage done by increasing double taxation. As estimated by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) and The Heritage Foundation’s Center for Data Analysis (CDA), the Camp plan is modestly pro-growth in the traditional 10-year budget window.", "Because the Camp plan does not implement its adverse capital cost recovery provisions until 2017, there will be an initial rush to invest before the new rules take effect. CDA analysis shows that by 2020, all increases in investment from the rate cuts evaporate and then investment begins to fall rapidly.", "It is highly questionable whether the Camp plan will remain pro-growth outside that 10-year window. Growth is boosted in the early years after the plan goes into effect because tax rates are lowered immediately. This strongly boosts work incentives and has a positive impact on economic growth. However, the economic damage from base-expansion policies that increase double taxation and impede investment will slow growth years later when the capital stock is less than it would have been had these changes not been made. It is likely that once those negative effects are fully in place, they will more than offset the positive effects from the modest tax rate reductions and growth will be negative.", "According to the JCT’s dynamic estimate, the growth effects of Camp’s tax reform plan could increase tax revenues between $50 billion and $700 billion", "—an exceedingly wide range. Assuming revenue came in at the upper end of the range, that money could be used to offset some of the anti-growth policies in the plan. For instance, reversing the most harmful tax increases on investment—the changes in depreciation, amortizing research and advertising expenses, and abolishing LIFO inventory accounting—would reduce revenue by $711 billion. This would make the Camp plan more pro-growth.", "Camp also followed the JCT’s rationale that extending the roughly 50 tax policies that expire regularly—known as tax extenders—is a tax cut. This required him to generate an unnecessary $1 trillion in his plan. That revenue could also be used to offset anti-growth policies in the plan.", "That the JCT offered a dynamic estimate of the Camp plan is a major victory. Until now, the JCT refused to estimate how the economy would grow with improved tax policy. Thanks to the work of Chairman Camp and his staff, there will now be strong pressure on the JCT to continue offering dynamic analysis of future tax bills.", "The official JCT score of the Camp plan is still the static analysis that assumes there is no improvement in the economy from tax reform; the dynamic analysis is a secondary estimate released in addition to its static score. In future tax reform efforts, it is imperative that Congress use the JCT’s dynamic analysis as the official score to provide a more accurate picture of how tax reform will affect both the economy and the budget.", "Despite its flaws, the Camp plan will keep the debate about tax reform alive in Washington and around the country. For that, Representative Camp deserves much credit because the economy and the country badly need tax reform.", "While the plan is unlikely to become law, it could spark a national debate, eventually leading to fundamental tax reform. Authors of future tax reform proposals should learn from Chairman Camp’s effort that maximizing the economic benefit of tax reform is extremely difficult when forced to balance pro-growth rate reductions and other positive reforms with adverse changes that hurt growth.", "Structuring such a reform to achieve a pro-growth result requires so many trade-offs that the result is likely to be far from ideal. It is better to start by defining the proper tax base first and then allowing the other facets of the tax system to fall into place. A tax reform plan that followed that approach would unequivocally reduce the tax bias against work, savings, investment, and entrepreneurship and promote opportunity, prosperity, job creation, and economic growth."]},

Mr. Orszag also correctly pointed out that public and private job categories aren't directly comparable, so we shouldn't necessarily expect them to have the same pay.

", "Conducted for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the CPS is a long-running survey that couples earnings and employment information with detailed demographic characteristics of the survey population. At first glance, the CPS data show that the average hourly wage for a federal worker is about 48% higher than a private worker's. Yet because federal employees tend to be more educated and experienced than their private counterparts, as Mr. Orszag noted, one has to control for these skill differences. This reduces the public-private salary gap—but it does not eliminate it. The federal wage premium for workers who have the same education and experience stands at 24%, still a windfall for public employees.", "Even using all the standard controls—including race and gender, full- or part-time work, firm size, marital status, region, residence in a city or suburb, and more—the federal wage premium does not disappear. It stubbornly hovers around 12%, meaning private employees must work 13½ months to earn what comparable federal workers make in 12. ", "Most academic studies dating back to the 1970s have found similar pay differences. In addition to the wage premium, federal workers enjoy more generous fringe benefits than do private workers. For instance, federal workers receive a defined benefit pension with benefit levels comparable to those from private 401(k) plans, except that federal workers contribute only 0.8% of pay and are not subject to any market risk. They also receive employer matches to the defined contribution Thrift Savings Plan that significantly exceed the typical private employer match. ", "If the overall generosity of federal benefits matches that of federal salaries (which seems quite likely), total compensation for federal workers may easily exceed $14,000 per year more than an otherwise similar private employee.", "The pay premium is probably the main reason federal workers quit their jobs at a far lower rate than do private employees. At the beginning of 2010, federal workers were only about one-third as likely to leave their jobs (a ratio not much different than in 2006, before the recession), implying that no private employer could offer them better compensation. ", "Federal employment also carries significant nonfinancial benefits—in particular that layoffs and firings are much rarer. If you think these aspects of federal employment lack value, ask any private employee who is now looking for work. A federal pay premium is unfair both to private workers, who receive less than their government peers, and to taxpayers who must cover the difference. Given our 2.7 million-strong federal work force, the government effectively overbills Americans by almost $40 billion every year just on labor costs. ", "Worker compensation is hardly the largest driver of current and future federal deficits. The biggest threat comes from the rising entitlement benefits of Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Nevertheless, if Washington demands \"painful sacrifices\" to make these programs solvent, as the slogan goes, it must first re-establish its credibility. Giving federal workers salaries, benefits and terms of employment comparable to those received by private workers would be a good start.", "\n      ", " "]},

The three options come with varying degrees of risk. President Donald Trump’s task is now to navigate among them—and while most Americans would agree that simply tolerating Iran’s nuclear program is intolerable, his options should not be constrained by either those who see only a military option, or those who rule one out.", "The Iranian nuclear program commands America’s attention first and foremost because it represents a direct threat to U.S. security. Iran has been, since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, an implacable enemy of the United States. Chants of “Death to America” and “Death to Israel” are not mere political rhetoric targeted at a domestic audience. Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei himself clarified that “‘Death to America!’ is not just a slogan—it is a policy.”", " In pursuit of this policy, Iran has repeatedly attacked American and allied targets, notably the 1983 Marine Barracks bombing in Beirut that cost 241 lives. The Iranian regime is responsible for the deaths of more than 603 Americans in Iraq between 2004 and 2011.", " As recently as January 2024, an Iranian-supported terror group operating in Iraq killed three American service members in a drone strike against Tower 22 in Jordan. This deadly aggression would only increase under a nuclear umbrella aimed at the United States.", "Iran has actively deployed increasingly sophisticated weapons systems for decades. This places Iranian nuclear weapons in a different category than, for example, Israel’s presumed capability. The Jewish State is assumed to have had nuclear weapons for more than a half century, which have never been deployed, nor have they prompted the regional nuclear proliferation—a regional nuclear arms race—that would follow an Iranian withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty in a presumed prelude to demonstrating nuclear capability.", "In addition, a nuclear Iran would be able to control the flow of energy from the Persian Gulf, the free passage of which has been defined as a vital U.S. national security interest since President Jimmy Carter established his eponymous doctrine in 1980.", " But the reasons why it is such an important American interest are very different some 45 years later. While still vulnerable to the price shock that would be caused by closing the Strait of Hormuz, the United States is no longer in need of these energy exports, having become one of the world’s three largest energy producers in the interim. The bulk of those exports go to Asia, particularly China, which does not have the capability or inclination to ensure their free flow and has been happy to cede that responsibility to America.", "If the U.S. continues to provide this protection, it should do so not only to avoid price shocks, but also to demonstrate control over the supply of energy to China from U.S. partners Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, which would provide significant leverage over China. Given the increasingly close cooperation between Iran and China, Iranian nuclear weapons would effectively evaporate this strategic advantage in the U.S. confrontation with China.", "Since tolerating a nuclear Iran would thus be a significant blow to U.S. national security, President Trump has prudently pursued a diplomatic solution before considering a military one. This means, however, stepping onto the Iranians’ preferred playing field, and, as the President has pointed out, the Iranians have never lost a negotiation. The track record is not encouraging. President Barack Obama’s Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was originally projected to be an end to Iran’s regional aggression and missile programs as well as its nuclear ambitions, but after three years of negotiations it was watered down to an acknowledgement of Iran’s “right” to a domestic nuclear program, including enrichment. The JCPOA merely delayed progress toward the technology required for a weapon and did not materially address any other issues, including Iran’s missile program and support for regional terror groups. President Trump correctly called the JCPOA “the worst deal in history”", " and ceased compliance with it in 2018, the same year that Israel recovered plans for nuclear weapons from the Amad archive in Tehran.", "These records proved that the JCPOA was fraudulently negotiated by the Iranians, who had insisted throughout that their nuclear program never had a military dimension, all the while secretly preserving plans for a weapon. This Iranian record of deception must be taken into account during any negotiation.", "Iran’s main reason for engagement with the Trump Administration appears to be stringing out the clock. Each day gained by Iran is an opportunity to re-build the missile defenses destroyed by Israel last October and to keep enriching uranium and plutonium. So, it is critical to put a hard timeline on the process or Iran will keep it going ad infinitum, or at least until October 25, 2025, when one of the few constructive, if never-employed, provisions of the JCPOA will expire. Until that date it is still possible to re-impose (snap back) the multilateral economic sanctions that were relaxed under that deal.", "Led by Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff, the U.S. diplomatic team appears to be heading down a different path from their predecessors. The Iranians “cannot have centrifuges. They have to downblend all of their fuel that they have there and send it to a far-away place,” Witkoff said in an interview with Breitbart on May 9.", " “An enrichment program can never exist in the state of Iran ever again. That’s our red line.” The Islamic Republic’s uranium enrichment facilities “have to be dismantled.” Under such terms, a good deal might be possible.", "President Trump himself was even more explicit in his speech in Riyadh on May 13, 2025, saying simply: “Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. But with that said, Iran can have a much brighter future, but we’ll never allow America and its allies to be threatened with terrorism or nuclear attack.”", "If the Trump Administration can expeditiously exact real concessions from the Iranian regime, to include a hard pause on its nuclear program while its full scope is assessed, a full and unambiguous dismantlement of enrichment facilities, a thorough accounting for the potential military dimensions of the program, and a resolution to the missile and regional terrorism issues before any economic relief is offered, there may be a path. It is, however, a steep one and a deal may only be possible if the Iranians believe there is a credible threat of military force that persuades them to give up the nuclear program to preserve their hold on power.", "If the President decides that negotiations have proven fruitless, a joint U.S.–Israeli military strike would become more likely. Of course, would be a momentous decision that brings with it a risk of a broader conflict. While that is a legitimate concern, it is by no means the inevitable outcome of an action targeted at Iran’s nuclear facilities. In fact, history indicates that limited strikes on rogue nuclear programs do not result in war: in 1981 and 2007, for example, Israel executed successful targeted strikes on both Iraq’s and Syria’s nuclear programs without igniting regional conflicts.", "From President Ronald Reagan’s devastating Operation Praying Mantis in 1988 to President Trump’s bold order to eliminate Quds Force commander Qasam Soliemani in 2020 to Israel’s effective missile strikes directly against Iran in 2024 (the second of which decimated Iran’s missile defenses), Iran’s responses to decisive military action have been impotent. Today, Tehran has few retaliatory options, as Israel has significantly degraded Hamas and decapitated Hezbollah, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has lost its foothold in Syria, and the Trump Administration has degraded the Houthis, a campaign that Israel is continuing.", "Between the United States and Israel, there are sufficient capabilities to not only execute a strike that would effectively end Iran’s nuclear program without significant civilian casualties, but also to deter significant retaliation. The Obama-era talking point that the only alternative to a JCPOA-style deal is a nuclear world war is not, in fact, the only choice. Thanks to Israel’s effective bombing strike last October in response to an Iranian attack, Iran is as weak and vulnerable as it has ever been, and painfully aware of Israel’s ability to strike at will, an ability that would only become more effective with American participation.", "President Trump has already assembled significant American assets in the region that would likely deter an escalatory Iranian response by demonstrating vastly superior capabilities. Should Tehran, for example, attempt another attack on Saudi Arabia’s energy infrastructure, the U.S. and Israel could easily destroy Iran’s Kharg Island’s oil terminal, which processes 90 percent of its oil exports, fatally crippling its economy and threatening the regime’s hold on the country. The Iranian regime knows this and would hardly risk its own survival even for its nuclear program.", "All those who want to minimize the possibility of war should support President Trump’s effort to make a deal with Iran that prevents that implacably hostile regime from obtaining a nuclear weapon. There is a strong case to be made, however, that if these negotiations fail, rather than igniting an uncontrollable regional war, a targeted strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities could end the threat that has been gathering for 25 years and menaces not only America and Israel, but also U.S. regional Arab partners and threatens the global economy. Given the significant degradation that has been caused to the Iranian regional proxies Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis over the past year and a half without causing a broader conflict, action against Iran’s nuclear capabilities may have a similar outcome, while neutralizing a major national security threat to the United States.", "In dealing with this grave dilemma, President Trump needs all tools at his disposal, and his options should not be constrained by either those who see only a military option, or those who rule one out. Peace through strength does not mean rushing to war, nor does it mean a deal at any cost. The key will be to effectively enforce President Trump’s redline that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon by whatever means he chooses."]},

Yet for reasons unknown, Louisiana didn’t take it. Instead, Louisiana spends most of its brief arguing that “race did not predominate” and that, even if it did, the state was justified because Section 2 requires racial gerrymandering.", "The thing about catch-22s is that you can only get out of them if you break one of the two impossible premises that define them. Louisiana hasn't attempted to do that here. It seems so desperate to win this particular lawsuit that it has missed an opportunity to win all future ones by breaking the catch-22. A paragraph of its opening brief argues that the Court should hold that racial-gerrymandering cases present “judicially unanswerable questions properly left to the political branches.” But without further analysis, the Court is not likely to entertain the argument. The Chief and the three liberals will remain constant; the four dissenters will remain constant. Only Kavanaugh is persuadable, and although he told Louisiana exactly what he needed, the state hasn’t given it to him.", "A shame because Louisiana is right that the status quo is “impossible,” and Thomas is right that racial gerrymandering has “divisive consequences.” One way or another, it should end.

That means the sound of the waves, the smell of the salt air, and a good evening bonfire.", "But obviously, there’s something missing: the actual “memorial” part of Memorial Day.", "That’s ironic, given that I’m a conservative—a label that implies a belief that there’s something in the past worth remembering and preserving.", "But for most of my life, I can’t recall wondering what I was supposed to be remembering and why I was supposed to be remembering it. Instead, I treated Memorial Day like any other holiday—just an excuse to take a day off and relax.", "I’m not the only one.", "According to a 2020 survey, ", " of Americans understood the real reason we celebrate Memorial Day. A full 36% weren’t sure of the difference between Veterans Day and Memorial Day.", "This ignorance may seem shameful. But in my opinion, it’s more reflective of the relative peace our generation has inherited—and our resulting lack of perspective on suffering and sacrifice.", "We face conflicts, yes, and there are brave service men and women who daily put their lives on the line to protect our country. But thankfully, most of us haven’t experienced the unique tragedy of losing an immediate family member to war.", "Obviously, this means Memorial Day may hold less meaning for us than it did for, say, my grandparents’ generation—a generation directly affected by World War II.", "Born during World War II, my grandfather, himself a Navy veteran, didn’t even get to meet his father until he was a year old. The reason? My great-grandfather was away, serving his country in the military.", "That delay in meeting one’s child is a sacrifice unimaginable to many today. But it pales in comparison to that made by those who have laid down their lives in service.", "Yet today, we struggle to appreciate their sacrifice, in part because we’re so distanced from it. We’ve lost perspective on how much it’s truly worth.", "The phrase “first-world problems” has grown cliché, but it’s apt in this instance. Most of us haven’t had to face the same kind of life-or-death scenarios as did our grandparents and great-grandparents, so we struggle to understand the significance of their courageous choices.", "That lack of perspective is the reason most people don’t appreciate Memorial Day for all it’s worth. At least, that’s certainly why I didn’t.", "Recently, though, I had the chance to catch up with my grandparents. And while we didn’t dwell on my grandfather’s time in the service, simply hearing their wisdom—wrought in long lives of cheerful hard work, dedication, and love—reminded me how much I owe, both to them and to those who paid the ultimate price.", "“Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,” reads John 15:13.", "So enjoy your long Memorial Day weekend. Bask in the summer sun. Eat a hot dog—or don’t, if you’re trying to go MAHA.", "But if you get the chance, sit down with an older friend or family member—someone who has stories to share of their generation’s sacrifice and service. You may find yourself leaving the conversation encouraged, challenged, and with a deeper appreciation for those who have shown the greatest love possible to their fellow man."]},
{"title": "Why This Is the Dawning of “America’s Golden Age”", "text": ["On the evening of May 29, at Roy Thomson Hall in downtown Toronto, Kellyanne Conway and I will debate Ezra Klein and Ben Rhodes. The proposition: ", "I will argue—without apology—that it is the beginning of such an era in American history.", "Now, I know I’m walking into a headwind.", "A ", " taken in April 2025 shows that just 26% of Canadians view the United States positively, down 28 points from last July. Worse still, that’s four points below the number who hold a favorable view of Communist China. Let’s not kid ourselves—the room will be filled with Torontonians—cosmopolitan, secular and suspicious of American strength.", "And our opponents will make full use of that.", "Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser under Barack Obama, will no doubt paint President Donald Trump’s “America First” foreign policy as dangerous, backwards and possibly even fascist. He’ll gesture toward foreign conflicts and insist Trump is undermining the world order and empowering strongmen abroad.", "Ezra Klein, writing from the editorial heights of ", ", will likely pivot to domestic matters. His golden age, as articulated in his new book, looks like a Leviathan state imposing a green revolution from the top down in the name of “abundance.” He’ll argue that Trump’s reforms have made the government more corrupt, not more capable.", "And yes—they’ll both probably mention, with theatrical outrage, Trump’s quip about Canada becoming our 51st state.", "But all their finger-wagging will miss the mark.", "America’s new golden age is not a product of Trump alone, or of some novel doctrine in foreign affairs, or even of a reinvigorated administrative state. It is something far deeper, far older and far more consequential. It is the rebirth of the simple but revolutionary idea that our nation must not be ruled by technocrats defending the interests of an elite class, but governed by the people and focused on championing the simple faith, freedom and family values found at the everyday American’s dinner table.", "Klein and Rhodes can’t see this. Their world view is frozen in the years when they still held sway—the waning days of the Obama era. But the revolt began then. Trump’s 2016 victory cracked the system. His 2020 defeat—mired in irregularities and delivered amid a pandemic that exposed rot at the core of our institutions—blew it wide open.", "When states like Pennsylvania changed election laws in the eleventh hour, Americans saw it for what it was—manipulation. When mandates forced millions to take experimental vaccines, they saw the corporate state in action. When children were catechized with radical ideologies over Zoom calls, Americans saw the corruption of public education. And when churches were closed week after week, even those Americans who didn’t believe in God felt the spiritual tyranny of a regime that had lost all reverence for the sacred.", "And when the Canadian government arrested and de-banked peaceful truckers in Ottawa, Americans saw a mirror—and a warning.", "The result? A great unravelling—and a great awakening.", "The public’s trust in elite institutions has collapsed. But in its place, new life is gathering momentum. The vacuum left by corporate media has been filled by men like Joe Rogan and Canada’s own Jordan Peterson, who speak plainly and defend free thought. The hollowing out of public health has birthed a grassroots movement to make America healthy in body and spirit. The failure of public schools has ignited a renaissance in classical education, returning young Americans to the eternal truths of the West.", "This same renewal is underway in higher education, in business, in culture and in politics.", "Everywhere you look, Americans—black and white, urban and rural, religious and secular—are saying “enough.” They are building new institutions, grounded in timeless principles. They are rediscovering ordered liberty, moral clarity and national purpose. They are rejecting the rule of the managerial elite and reclaiming the mantle of self-government.", "That is what makes this the dawn of a new golden age.", "Rhodes and Klein, ensconced in the power centers of Washington, New York and Los Angeles, remain blind to it. But some Canadians may see it more clearly than they do. After all, we share more than a border. We share a legacy. A frontier spirit.", "A civilizational inheritance rooted in the dignity of the individual and the sovereignty of the people.", "On May 29, I will say this to our Canadian friends: Whether or not you wish to be the 51st state, you should want to be part of what’s happening in America today. Because this golden age is not just an American revival—it is a rebuke to the failed technocracy of the Western world. And it is just beginning."]},
