#  AnaLOG Tracking Assignment

**Due**: June 19, 2025
**Length**: raw data log, & 1–2 pages of reflection 

## Overview

To create some context for building automated bots, you'll first
collect data the old-fashioned way—by hand, with your own attention as
the primary tool.

For this assignment, choose one real-world subject to observe
repeatedly over **5 days**. Try to chose days that are as close to
consecutive as possible, and as similar time each day as possible (for
example, Monday - Friday everyday at ~9am).

Your subject can be anything that changes over time: your meals, a
tree, a bus stop, a garden or park, etc. You can get creative, you can
be political, or you can be super simple. The goal is to practice
**systematic observation**, notice patterns, and reflect on the
experience of **manual data collection**.

You’ll keep a short daily journal and submit both your **raw
observations** and a **1–2 page reflection** on the experience.

## What to Do Each Day

Spend at least **10 minutes** each day observing your subject. As you
are doing so, answer the following prompts in a notebook or digital
doc:

1. Day
2. Time
3. Location
4. Observations
5. Feelings/Thoughts
6. Misc. Notes
7. (Optional) Include a photo, sketch, or visual note.

Feel free to add any categories that pertain to your specific case.
For example, if you are observing a protest/strike, you can add a
column to note the number of strikers or protesters that day.

## Final Submission Instructions (due June 19th)

Compile a packet (in PDF format) that includes the following documents:

- Your daily tracking journal (ideally in a table format, but can also
  be bulleted list)
- A 1–2 page reflection answering:
  - What patterns did you see?
  - How did your tracking methods evolve?
  - What choices are you making about what counts as "data"? Why?
  - What would be easy or hard to automate about this process?
